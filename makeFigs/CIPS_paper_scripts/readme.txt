Codes for the Paper Catalysis-Induced Phase Separation and Autoregulation of Enzymatic Activity (Matthew W. Cotton, Ramin Golestanian, and Jaime Agudo-Canalejo)
https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.158101


Structure of files:

* Simulations of the full system were run in MatLab using the scripts in the folder MATLABscripts (outputs into the Figures and numerics-out folders)
* Binodal phases calculated and saved using the script in save_tangents.py
* Figures for the paper generated by the code in paper_plots.ipynb using the data files named new5000*.txt and 20210907180535_tangent.csv which were generated with the MATLAB and python scripts (NB: format for new5000*.txt was modified after being output)
*Tools for plotting and analysis are in better_mob.py


Requirements:

Packages used are standard scientific packages (i.e. included in Anaconda) and additionally used 'ternary' for ternary plots (https://github.com/marcharper/python-ternary).

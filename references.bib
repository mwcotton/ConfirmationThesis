              Characterization of the genetic landscape of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADD) provides a unique opportunity for a better understanding of the associated pathophysiological processes. We performed a two-stage genome-wide association study totaling 111,326 clinically diagnosed/‘proxy’ AD cases and 677,663 controls. We found 75 risk loci, of which 42 were new at the time of analysis. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed the involvement of amyloid/tau pathways and highlighted microglia implication. Gene prioritization in the new loci identified 31 genes that were suggestive of new genetically associated processes, including the tumor necrosis factor alpha pathway through the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex. We also built a new genetic risk score associated with the risk of future AD/dementia or progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD/dementia. The improvement in prediction led to a 1.6- to 1.9-fold increase in AD risk from the lowest to the highest decile, in addition to effects of age and the

In DS persons ranging from 40-49 years of age, 5.7-55\% may be clinically demented and between 50-59 years, dementia prevalence ranges from 4-55\% (reviewed in []). Despite the wide ranges reported for dementia prevalence, a consistent feature of aging in DS is the progressive accumulation of AD brain pathologies. By the age of 40 years, virtually all have sufficient senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles for a neuropathological diagnosis of AD []. Thus, there is dissociation between the age of onset of AD neuropathology (40 years) and increasing signs of clinical dementia. We discuss the hypothesis that frontal impairments are a critical factor affecting cognitive function and are associated with white matter (WM) and AD neuropathology. While these may be an early sign of conversion to dementia, we also review several other clinical comorbidities that may also contribute to dementia onset.},

Causes of increased mortality rates early in life are primarily due to the increased incidence of congenital heart disease and leukemia, while causes of higher mortality rates later in life may be due to a number of factors, two of which are an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and an apparent tendency toward premature aging. In this article, we describe the increase in lifespan for people with DS that has occurred over the past 100 years, as well as advances in the understanding of the occurrence of AD in adults with DS. Aspects of the neurobiology of AD, including the role of amyloid, oxidative stress, Cu/ZN dismutase (SOD-1), as well as advances in neuroimaging are presented. The function of risk factors in the observed heterogeneity in the expression of AD dementia in adults with DS, as well as the need for sensitive and specific biomarkers of the clinical and pathological progressing of AD in adults with DS is considered. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease with no approved disease-modifying therapies. Multiplications, mutations, and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SNCA gene, encoding α-synuclein (aSyn) protein, either cause or increase risk for PD. Intracellular accumulations of aSyn are pathological hallmarks of PD. Taken together, reduction of aSyn production may provide a disease-modifying therapy for PD. We show that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) reduce production of aSyn in rodent preformed fibril (PFF) models of PD. Reduced aSyn production leads to prevention and removal of established aSyn pathology and prevents dopaminergic cell dysfunction. In addition, we address the translational potential of the approach through characterization of human SNCA-targeting ASOs that efficiently suppress the human SNCA transcript in vivo. We demonstrate broad activity and distribution of the human SNCA ASOs throughout the nonhuman primate brain and a corresponding decrease in aSyn cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) levels. Taken together, these data suggest that, by inhibiting production of aSyn, it may be possible to reverse established pathology; thus, these data support the development of SNCA ASOs as a potential disease-modifying therapy for PD and related synucleinopathies.,},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Through advances in the past decades, the central role of aberrant protein aggregation has been established in many neurodegenerative diseases. Crucially, however, the molecular mechanisms that underlie aggregate proliferation in the brains of affected individuals are still only poorly understood. Under controlled {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vitro{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} conditions, significant progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that take place during the assembly of purified protein molecules, through advances in both experimental methods and the theories used to analyse the resulting data. The determination of the aggregation mechanism for a variety of proteins revealed the importance of intermediate oligomeric species and of the interactions with promotors and inhibitors. Such mechanistic insights, if they can be achieved in a disease-relevant system, provide invaluable information to guide the design of potential cures to these devastating disorders. However, as experimental systems approach the situation present in real disease, their complexity increases substantially. Timescales increase from hours an aggregation reaction takes {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vitro{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, to decades over which the process takes place in disease, and length-scales increase to the dimension of a human brain. Thus, molecular level mechanistic studies, like those that successfully determined mechanisms {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vitro{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, have only been applied in a handful of living systems to date. If their application can be extended to further systems, including patient data, they promise powerful new insights. Here we present a review of the existing strategies to gain mechanistic insights into the molecular steps driving protein aggregation and discuss the obstacles and potential paths to achieving their application in disease. First, we review the experimental approaches and analysis techniques that are used to establish the aggregation mechanisms {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vitro{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and the insights that have been gained from them. We then discuss how these approaches must be modified and adapted to be applicable {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vivo{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and review the existing works that have successfully applied mechanistic analysis of protein aggregation in living systems. Finally, we present a broad mechanistic classification of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vivo{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} systems and discuss what will be required to further our understanding of aggregate formation in living systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative condition diagnosed in North America. We recently demonstrated, using multiple epidemiological data sources, that the prevalence of PD diagnoses was greater than previously reported and currently used for clinical, research, and policy decision-making. Prior PD incidence estimates have varied, for unclear reasons. There is a need for improved estimates of PD incidence, not only for care delivery planning and future policy but also for increasing our understanding of disease risk. The objective of this study was thus to investigate the incidence of Parkinson disease across five epidemiological cohorts in North America in a common year, 2012. The cohorts contained data on 6.7 million person-years of adults ages 45 and older, and 9.3 million person-years of adults ages 65 and older. Our estimates of age-sex-adjusted incidence of PD ranged from 108 to 212 per 100,000 among persons ages 65 and older, and from 47 to 77 per 100,00 among persons ages 45 and older. PD incidence increased with age and was higher among males. We also found persistent spatial clustering of incident PD diagnoses in the U.S. PD incidence estimates varied across our data sources, in part due to case ascertainment and diagnosis methods, but also possibly due to the influence of population factors (prevalence of genetic risk factors or protective markers) and geographic location (exposure to environmental toxins). Understanding the source of these variations will be important for health care policy, research, and care planning.},

	abstract = {Parkinson disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects 2–3\% of the population ≥65 years of age. Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, which causes striatal dopamine deficiency, and intracellular inclusions containing aggregates of α-synuclein are the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson disease. Multiple other cell types throughout the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system are also involved, probably from early disease onwards. Although clinical diagnosis relies on the presence of bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, Parkinson disease is associated with many non-motor symptoms that add to overall disability. The underlying molecular pathogenesis involves multiple pathways and mechanisms: α-synuclein proteostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport and neuroinflammation. Recent research into diagnostic biomarkers has taken advantage of neuroimaging in which several modalities, including PET, single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and novel MRI techniques, have been shown to aid early and differential diagnosis. Treatment of Parkinson disease is anchored on pharmacological substitution of striatal dopamine, in addition to non-dopaminergic approaches to address both motor and non-motor symptoms and deep brain stimulation for those developing intractable L-DOPA-related motor complications. Experimental therapies have tried to restore striatal dopamine by gene-based and cell-based approaches, and most recently, aggregation and cellular transport of α-synuclein have become therapeutic targets. One of the greatest current challenges is to identify markers for prodromal disease stages, which would allow novel disease-modifying therapies to be started earlier.},

This Review discusses the pathogenesis of AD, PD and other neurodegenerative diseases, and describes their associations with the nine biological hallmarks of ageing: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, deregulated nutrient sensing, stem cell exhaustion and altered intercellular communication. The central biological mechanisms of ageing and their potential as targets of novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases are also discussed, with potential therapies including NAD+ precursors, mitophagy inducers and inhibitors of cellular senescence.},

	abstract = {Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau pathologies, are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprising filamentous tau protein. Although emerging evidence suggests that tau pathology may be transmitted, we demonstrate here that synthetic tau fibrils are sufficient to transmit tau inclusions in a mouse model. Specifically, intracerebral inoculation of young PS19 mice overexpressing mutant human tau (P301S) with synthetic preformed fibrils (pffs) assembled from recombinant full-length tau or truncated tau containing four microtubule binding repeats resulted in rapid induction of NFT-like inclusions that propagated from injected sites to connected brain regions in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, injection of tau pffs into either hippocampus or striatum together with overlaying cortex gave rise to distinct pattern of spreading. Moreover, unlike tau pathology that spontaneously develops in old PS19 mice, the pff-induced tau inclusions more closely resembled AD NFTs because they were Thioflavin S positive, acetylated, and more resistant to proteinase K digestion. Together, our study demonstrates that synthetic tau pffs alone are capable of inducing authentic NFT-like tau aggregates and initiating spreading of tau pathology in a tauopathy mouse model.},

AA constitutes the insoluble fibrils, which are deposited in different organs, and is a major N-terminal part of the acute phase protein serum AA. It is not known why only some patients with chronic inflammation develop AA amyloidosis. Nucleation is a widely accepted mechanism in amyloidogenesis. Preformed amyloid-like fibrils act as nuclei in amyloid fibril formation in vitro, and AA amyloid fibrils and synthetic amyloid-like fibrils also may serve as seed for fibril formation in vivo. In addition to amyloid fibrils, there is a variety of similar nonmammalian protein fibrils with beta-pleated structure in nature. We studied three such naturally occurring protein fibrils: silk from Bombyx mori, Sup35 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and curli from Escherichia coli. Our results show that these protein fibrils exert amyloid-accelerating properties in the murine experimental AA amyloidosis, suggesting that such environment factors may be important risk factors in amyloidogenesis.},

We list the proteins that are known to be deposited as amyloid or other types of aggregates in human tissues and the disorders with which they are associated, as well as the proteins that exploit the amyloid motif to play speciﬁc functional roles in humans. In addition, we summarize the genetic factors that have provided insight into the mechanisms of disease onset. We describe recent advances in our knowledge of the structures of amyloid ﬁbrils and their oligomeric precursors and of the mechanisms by which they are formed and proliferate to generate cellular dysfunction. We show evidence that a complex proteostasis network actively combats protein aggregation and that such an efﬁcient system can fail in some circumstances and give rise to disease. Finally, we anticipate the development of novel therapeutic strategies with which to prevent or treat these highly debilitating and currently incurable conditions.},

              Mammalian cells remove misfolded proteins using various proteolytic systems, including the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system (UPS), chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA) and macroautophagy. The majority of misfolded proteins are degraded by the UPS, in which Ub-conjugated substrates are deubiquitinated, unfolded and cleaved into small peptides when passing through the narrow chamber of the proteasome. The substrates that expose a specific degradation signal, the KFERQ sequence motif, can be delivered to and degraded in lysosomes via the CMA. Aggregation-prone substrates resistant to both the UPS and the CMA can be degraded by macroautophagy, in which cargoes are segregated into autophagosomes before degradation by lysosomal hydrolases. Although most misfolded and aggregated proteins in the human proteome can be degraded by cellular protein quality control, some native and mutant proteins prone to aggregation into
              β
              -sheet-enriched oligomers are resistant to all known proteolytic pathways and can thus grow into inclusion bodies or extracellular plaques. The accumulation of protease-resistant misfolded and aggregated proteins is a common mechanism underlying protein misfolding disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s disease (HD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), prion diseases and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In this review, we provide an overview of the proteolytic pathways in neurons, with an emphasis on the UPS, CMA and macroautophagy, and discuss the role of protein quality control in the degradation of pathogenic proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we examine existing putative therapeutic strategies to efficiently remove cytotoxic proteins from degenerating neurons.},

By studying the generic spatial transport properties of such proteins, we investigate here whether their ability to reversibly associate and dissociate may confer on them a functional advantage with respect to nondissociating proteins. In uniform environments with position-independent association–dissociation, we find that enhanced diffusion in the monomeric state coupled to reassociation into the functional oligomeric form leads to enhanced reactivity with localized targets. In nonuniform environments with position-dependent association–dissociation, caused by, for example, spatial gradients of an inhibiting chemical, we find that dissociating proteins generically tend to accumulate in regions where they are most stable, a process that we term “stabilitaxis.”},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional solution structure of the 259-residue 30 kDa N-terminal domain of enzyme I (EIN) of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system of Escherichia coli has been determined by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Enzyme I, which is autophosphorylated by phosphoenolpyruvate, reversibly phosphorylates the phosphocarrier protein HPr, which in turn phosphorylates a group of membrane-associated proteins, known as enzymes II. To facilitate and confirm NH, 15N, and 13C assignments, extensive use was made of perdeuterated 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled protein to narrow line widths. Ninety-eight percent of the 1H, 15N, and 13C assignments for the backbone and first side chain atoms of protonated EIN were obtained using a combination of double and triple resonance correlation experiments. The structure determination was based on a total of 4251 experimental NMR restraints, and the precision of the coordinates for the final 50 simulated annealing structures is 0.79 ± 0.18 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.06 ± 0.15 Å for all atoms. The structure is ellipsoidal in shape, approximately 78 Å long and 32 Å wide, and comprises two domains:  an α/β domain (residues 1−20 and 148−230) consisting of six strands and three helices and an α-domain (residues 33−143) consisting of four helices. The two domains are connected by two linkers (residues 21−32 and 144−147), and in addition, at the C-terminus there is another helix which serves as a linker between the N- and C-terminal domains of intact enzyme I. A comparison with the recently solved X-ray structure of EIN [Liao, D.-I., Silverton, E., Seok, Y.-J., Lee, B. R., Peterkofsky, A., \& Davies, D. R. (1996) Structure 4, 861−872] indicates that there are no significant differences between the solution and crystal structures within the errors of the coordinates. The active site His189 is located in a cleft at the junction of the α and α/β domains and has a pKa of ∼6.3. His189 has a trans conformation about χ1, a g+ conformation about χ2, and its Nε2 atom accepts a hydrogen bond from the hydroxyl proton of Thr168. Since His189 is thought to be phosphorylated at the Nε2 position, its side chain conformation would have to change upon phosphorylation.},

Here, we use a combination of kinetic studies, selective radiolabeling experiments, and cell viability assays to detect directly the rates of formation of both fibrils and oligomers and the resulting cytotoxic effects. Our results show that once a small but critical concentration of amyloid fibrils has accumulated, the toxic oligomeric species are predominantly formed from monomeric peptide molecules through a fibril-catalyzed secondary nucleation reaction, rather than through a classical mechanism of homogeneous primary nucleation. This catalytic mechanism couples together the growth of insoluble amyloid fibrils and the generation of diffusible oligomeric aggregates that are implicated as neurotoxic agents in Alzheimer’s disease. These results reveal that the aggregation of Aβ42 is promoted by a positive feedback loop that originates from the interactions between the monomeric and fibrillar forms of this peptide. Our findings bring together the main molecular species implicated in the Aβ aggregation cascade and suggest that perturbation of the secondary nucleation pathway identified in this study could be an effective strategy to control the proliferation of neurotoxic Aβ42 oligomers.},

For frangible filaments, oligomers are present both at early times and at equilibrium, whereas in the absence of fragmentation, oligomers are only present in significant quantities at the beginning of the polymerisation reaction.

We explore here the use of fixed point analysis to provide self-consistent solutions to such growth problems. We present iterative solutions and discuss their convergence behaviour. We establish a range of closed form results for linear growth processes, including the scaling behaviours of the maximum growth rate and of the reaction end-point. We further show that a self-consistent approach applied to the master equation of filamentous growth allows the determination of the evolution of the shape of the length distribution including the mean, the standard deviation, and the mode.

Here, we developed a structural-alignment-based clustering algorithm—Foldseek cluster—that can cluster hundreds of millions of structures. Using this method, we have clustered all of the structures in the AlphaFold database, identifying 2.30 million non-singleton structural clusters, of which 31\% lack annotations representing probable previously undescribed structures. Clusters without annotation tend to have few representatives covering only 4\% of all proteins in the AlphaFold database. Evolutionary analysis suggests that most clusters are ancient in origin but 4\% seem to be species specific, representing lower-quality predictions or examples of de novo gene birth. We also show how structural comparisons can be used to predict domain families and their relationships, identifying examples of remote structural similarity. On the basis of these analyses, we identify several examples of human immune-related proteins with putative remote homology in prokaryotic species, illustrating the value of this resource for studying protein function and evolution across the tree of life.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

A key problem is then to extract estimates for the dynamics. In particular, if a single node is seeded at a small concentration, when will other nodes reach the same initial concentration? Here, motivated by the study of toxic protein propagation in neurodegenerative diseases, we present and compare three different estimates for the arrival time in order of increasing analytical complexity: the linear arrival time, obtained by linearizing the underlying dynamical system; the Lambert time, obtained by considering the interaction of pairs of nodes; and the nonlinear arrival time, obtained by asymptotic techniques. We use the classic Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov equation as a paradigm for the dynamics and show that each method provides different insights but consistent time estimates. Further, we show that the nonlinear asymptotic method also gives an approximate solution, valid in the entire domain, and the correct ordering of arrival regions over large regions of parameters and initial conditions.},

The mechanism of the coupling between these two processes to enable homeostasis is not well understood. Recently, an ultrafast endocytosis (UFE) pathway was revealed with a speed significantly exceeding classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Membrane tension reduction is a potential mechanism by which endocytosis can be rapidly activated at remote sites. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a mechanism whereby membrane tension reduction initiates membrane budding and tubulation mediated by endocytic proteins, such as endophilin A1. We find that shape instabilities occur at well-defined membrane tensions and surface densities of endophilin. From our data, we obtain a membrane shape stability diagram that shows remarkable consistency with a quantitative model. This model applies to all laterally diffusive curvature-coupling proteins and therefore a wide range of endocytic proteins.},

Recent simulations have revealed that BAR proteins assemble into linear aggregates, strongly affecting membrane curvature and its in-plane stress profile. Here, we explore the opposite question: do mechanical properties of the membrane impact protein association? By using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we show that increased surface tension significantly impacts the dynamics of protein assembly. While tensionless membranes promote a rapid formation of long-living linear aggregates of N-BAR proteins, increase in tension alters the geometry of protein association. At high tension, protein interactions are strongly inhibited. Increasing surface density of proteins leads to a wider range of protein association geometries, promoting the formation of meshes, which can be broken apart with membrane tension. Our work indicates that surface tension may play a key role in recruiting proteins to membrane-remodelling sites in the cell., 
BAR domain proteins are known to reshape cell membranes. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, Simunovic and Voth demonstrate that membrane tension strongly affects the association of BAR proteins, in turn controlling their recruitment to membrane-remodelling sites.},

We find that the latter are comparable to the sum of the two-body contributions. For N = 5 inclusions, the analytical asymptotic interaction scales as the inverse sixth power of the nearest neighbors distance d, weaker than the d−4 power for N ≠ 5. The analytical interactions are always repulsive and in good agreement with the numerical results. In the case of noncircular cross sections, we consider the case of two identical inclusions having a given number of equally shaped lobes. Depending on the number of lobes and their amplitude, we find that the interaction is asymptotically either repulsive as d−4 or attractive as d−2, and always repulsive at short distances. We also characterize how the interaction depends on the inclusion rotation angles in the membrane plane.},

	abstract = {Highly wedge-shaped integral membrane proteins, or membrane-adsorbed proteins can induce long-ranged deformations. The strain in the surrounding bilayer creates relatively long-ranged forces that contribute to interactions with nearby proteins. In contrast, to direct short-ranged interactions such as van der Waal's, hydrophobic, or electrostatic interactions, both local membrane Gaussian curvature and protein ellipticity can induce forces acting at distances of up to a few times their typical radii. These forces can be attractive or repulsive, depending on the proteins' shape, height, contact angle with the bilayer, and a pre-existing local membrane curvature. Although interaction energies are not pairwise additive, for sufficiently low protein density, thermodynamic properties depend only upon pair interactions. Here, we compute pair interaction potentials and entropic contributions to the two-dimensional osmotic pressure of a collection of noncircular proteins. For flat membranes, bending rigidities of approximately 100k(B)T, moderate ellipticities, and large contact angle proteins, we find thermally averaged attractive interactions of order k(B)T. These interactions may play an important role in the intermediate stages of protein aggregation. Numerous biological processes where membrane bending-mediated interactions may be relevant are cited, and possible experiments are discussed.},

	abstract = {Many cellular processes rely on precise and timely deformation of the cell membrane. While many proteins participate in membrane reshaping and scission, usually in highly specialized ways, Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain proteins play a pervasive role, as they not only participate in many aspects of cell trafficking but also are highly versatile membrane remodelers. Subtle changes in the shape and size of the BAR domain can greatly impact the way in which BAR domain proteins interact with the membrane. Furthermore, the activity of BAR domain proteins can be tuned by external physical parameters, and so they behave differently depending on protein surface density, membrane tension, or membrane shape. These proteins can form 3D structures that mold the membrane and alter its liquid properties, even promoting scission under various circumstances.As such, BAR domain proteins have numerous roles within the cell. Endocytosis is among the most highly studied processes in which BAR domain proteins take on important roles. Over the years, a more complete picture has emerged in which BAR domain proteins are tied to almost all intracellular compartments; examples include endosomal sorting and tubular networks in the endoplasmic reticulum and T-tubules. These proteins also have a role in autophagy, and their activity has been linked with cancer. Here, we briefly review the history of BAR domain protein discovery, discuss the mechanisms by which BAR domain proteins induce curvature, and attempt to settle important controversies in the field. Finally, we review BAR domain proteins in the context of a cell, highlighting their emerging roles in cell signaling and organelle shaping.},

For one model mixture in particular, DPPC/DOPC/Chol, we have mapped phase boundaries for the full ternary system. For this mixture we observe two coexisting liquid phases over a wide range of lipid composition and temperature, with one phase rich in the unsaturated lipid and the other rich in the saturated lipid and cholesterol. We ﬁnd a simple relationship between chain melting temperature and miscibility transition temperature that holds for both phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin lipids. We experimentally cross miscibility boundaries both by changing temperature and by the depletion of cholesterol with b-cyclodextrin. Liquid domains in vesicles exhibit interesting behavior: they collide and coalesce, can ﬁnger into stripes, and can bulge out of the vesicle. To date, we have not observed macroscopic separation of liquid phases in only binary lipid mixtures.},

Membrane phase separation has been reconstituted in simplified model systems, and its detailed physicochemical principles, including essential phase diagrams, have been extensively explored. These model membrane systems have proven very useful to study the heterogeneity in cellular membranes, however, concerns have been raised about how reliably they can represent native membranes. In this review, we will discuss how phase-separated membrane systems can mimic cellular membranes and where they fail to reflect the native cell membrane heterogeneity. We also include a few humble suggestions on which phase-separated systems should be used for certain applications, and which interpretations should be avoided to prevent unreliable conclusions.},

Nanoscopic phases ({\textless}200 nm) can provide a model for membrane rafts, specialized membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin, which are believed to have essential biological functions in cell membranes. Crucial questions are whether lipid nanodomains can exist in stable equilibrium in membranes and what is the distribution of their sizes and lifetimes in membranes of different composition.

Although many enzymes clearly form functional mega-assemblies, it is not yet clear for many recently discovered cases whether they represent functional entities, storage bodies, or aggregates. In this article, we survey intracellular protein bodies formed by metabolic enzymes, asking when and why such bodies form and what their formation implies for the functionality--and dysfunctionality--of the enzymes that comprise them. The panoply of intracellular protein bodies also raises interesting questions regarding their evolution and maintenance within cells.

	abstract = {Metabolites can inhibit the enzymes that generate them. To explore the general nature of metabolic self-inhibition, we surveyed enzymological data accrued from a century of experimentation and generated a genome-scale enzyme-inhibition network. Enzyme inhibition is often driven by essential metabolites, affects the majority of biochemical processes, and is executed by a structured network whose topological organization is reflecting chemical similarities that exist between metabolites. Most inhibitory interactions are competitive, emerge in the close neighbourhood of the inhibited enzymes, and result from structural similarities between substrate and inhibitors. Structural constraints also explain one-third of allosteric inhibitors, a finding rationalized by crystallographic analysis of allosterically inhibited L-lactate dehydrogenase. Our findings suggest that the primary cause of metabolic enzyme inhibition is not the evolution of regulatory metabolite–enzyme interactions, but a finite structural diversity prevalent within the metabolome. In eukaryotes, compartmentalization minimizes inevitable enzyme inhibition and alleviates constraints that self-inhibition places on metabolism.},

These objects, in solutions in which chemical reactions were occurring, were observed to diffuse (spread non-directionally) or swim (move directionally) at rates exceeding those expected from Brownian motion alone. The debates have focused on whether observed enhancement is an experimental artefact or a real phenomenon. If the latter were true, then we would also need to explain how the chemical energy is converted into mechanical work. In this Perspective, we summarize and discuss recent observations and theories of active diffusion and swimming. Notably, the chemomechanical coupling and magnitude of diffusion enhancement are strongly size-dependent and should vanish as the size of the swimmers approaches the molecular scale. We evaluate the reliability of common techniques to measure diffusion coefficients and finish by considering the potential applications and chemical to mechanical energy conversion efficiencies of typical nanoswimmers and microswimmers.},

Radial distribution functions are analyzed to gain an understanding of the liquid structure influencing the diffusion processes. It is shown that cluster formation in mixtures containing one alcoholic component has a significant impact on the diffusion process. The estimation of the thermodynamic factor from experimental vapor-liquid equilibrium data is investigated, considering three excess Gibbs energy models, i.e., Wilson, NRTL, and UNIQUAC. It is found that the Wilson model yields the thermodynamic factor that best suits the simulation results for the prediction of the Fick diffusion coefficient. Four semi-empirical methods for the prediction of the self-diffusion coefficients and nine predictive equations for the Fick diffusion coefficient are assessed and it is found that methods based on local composition models are more reliable. Finally, the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity are predicted and in most cases favorably compared with experimental literature values.},

Aiming to identify common features of these mixtures, it is found that one of the main diffusion coefficients and the smaller eigenvalue do not depend on the type of alcohol along the studied composition path. Two mechanisms that are responsible for this invariant behavior are discussed in detail, i.e., the interplay between kinetic and thermodynamic contributions to Fick diffusion coefficients and the presence of microscopic heterogeneities caused by hydrogen bonding. Experimental work alone cannot explain these mechanisms, while present simulations on the molecular level indicate structural changes and uniform intermolecular interactions between benzene and acetone molecules in the three ternary mixtures. The main diffusion coefficients of these ternary mixtures exhibit similarities with their binary subsystems. Analyses of radial distribution functions and hydrogen bonding statistics quantitatively evidence alcohol self-association and cluster formation, as well as component segregation. Furthermore, the excess volume of the mixtures is analyzed in the light of intermolecular interactions, further demonstrating the benefits of the simultaneous use of experiment and simulation. The proposed framework for studying diffusion coefficients of a set of ternary mixtures, where only one component varies, opens the way for further investigations and a better understanding of multicomponent diffusion. The presented numerical results may also give an impulse to the development of predictive approaches for multicomponent diffusion.},

            Cells compartmentalize parts of their interiors into liquid-like condensates, which can be reconstituted in vitro. Although these condensates interact with membrane-bound organelles, their potential for membrane remodeling and the underlying mechanisms of such interactions are not well-understood. Here, we demonstrate that interactions between protein condensates - including hollow ones, and membranes can lead to remarkable morphological transformations and provide a theoretical framework to describe them. Modulation of solution salinity or membrane composition drives the condensate-membrane system through two wetting transitions, from dewetting, through a broad regime of partial wetting, to complete wetting. When sufficient membrane area is available, fingering or ruffling of the condensate-membrane interface is observed, an intriguing phenomenon producing intricately curved structures. The observed morphologies are governed by the interplay of adhesion, membrane elasticity, and interfacial tension. Our results highlight the relevance of wetting in cell biology, and pave the way for the design of synthetic membrane-droplet based biomaterials and compartments with tunable properties.},

These model mixtures include cholesterol, together with one high-melting lipid and one low-melting lipid. An interesting ﬁnding is of two categories of such 3-component mixtures, leading to what we term Type I and Type II compositional phase diagrams. The latter have phase regions of macroscopic coexisting domains of \{Lα + Lβ + Lo\} and of \{Lα + Lo\}, with domains resolved under the light microscope. Type I mixtures have the same phase coexistence regions, but the domains seem to be nanoscopic. Type I mixtures are likely to be better models for biological membranes.},

	abstract = {We discuss the stochastic trajectories of single molecules in a phase-separated liquid, when a dense and a dilute phase coexist. Starting from a continuum theory of macroscopic phase separation we derive a stochastic Langevin equation for molecular trajectories that takes into account thermal fluctuations. We find that molecular trajectories can be described as diffusion with drift in an effective potential, which has a steep gradient at phase boundaries. We discuss how the physics of phase coexistence affects the statistics of molecular trajectories and in particular the statistics of displacements of molecules crossing a phase boundary. At thermodynamic equilibrium detailed balance imposes that the distributions of displacements crossing the phase boundary from the dense or from the dilute phase are the same. Our theory can be used to infer key phase separation parameters from the statistics of single-molecule trajectories. For simple Brownian motion, there is no drift in the presence of a concentration gradient. We show that interactions in the fluid give rise to an average drift velocity in concentration gradients. Interestingly, under non-equilibrium conditions, single molecules tend to drift uphill the concentration gradient. Thus, our work bridges between single-molecule dynamics and collective dynamics at macroscopic scales and provides a framework to study single-molecule dynamics in phase-separating systems.},

To investigate nucleation barriers in living cells, we developed distributed amphiﬂuoric FRET (DAmFRET). DAmFRET exploits a photoconvertible ﬂuorophore, heterogeneous expression, and large cell numbers to quantify via ﬂow cytometry the extent of a protein’s self-assembly as a function of cellular concentration. We show that kinetic barriers limit the nucleation of ordered self-assemblies and that the persistence of the barriers with respect to concentration relates to structure. Supersaturation resulting from sequence-encoded nucleation barriers gave rise to prion behavior and enabled a prion-forming protein, Sup35 PrD, to partition into dynamic intracellular condensates or to form toxic aggregates. Our results suggest that nucleation barriers govern cytoplasmic inheritance, subcellular organization, and proteotoxicity.},

Here we examine the behaviour of droplets in systems that are maintained away from thermodynamic equilibrium by an external supply of energy. In these systems, droplets grow by the addition of droplet material generated by chemical reactions. Surprisingly, we find that chemically driven droplet growth can lead to shape instabilities that trigger the division of droplets into two smaller daughters. Therefore, chemically active droplets can exhibit cycles of growth and division that resemble the proliferation of living cells.

            One of the greatest mysteries concerning the origin of life is how it has emerged so quickly after the formation of the earth. In particular, it is not understood how metabolic cycles, which power the non-equilibrium activity of cells, have come into existence in the first instances. While it is generally expected that non-equilibrium conditions would have been necessary for the formation of primitive metabolic structures, the focus has so far been on externally imposed non-equilibrium conditions, such as temperature or proton gradients. Here, we propose an alternative paradigm in which naturally occurring non-reciprocal interactions between catalysts that can partner together in a cyclic reaction lead to their recruitment into self-organized functional structures. We uncover different classes of self-organized cycles that form through exponentially rapid coarsening processes, depending on the parity of the cycle and the nature of the interaction motifs, which are all generic but have readily tuneable features.},

nature, to derive solutions to these equations except for special cases. The
availability of general analytical solutions provides a route for determining
the rates of molecular level processes from the analysis of macroscopic
experimental measurements of the growth kinetics, in addition to the
phenomenological parameters, such as lag times and maximal growth rates that are

self-consistent solutions for the growth of filamentous structures that can, in
addition to elongation, undergo internal fracturing and monomer-dependent

Our results generalise the analytical expression for sigmoidal growth kinetics

Many experimental studies indicate that the ability of existing aggregates to replicate is a key property in generating their pathogenic effect across a range of diseases. However, given the complexity of the process in vivo, no principled general approach currently exists to obtain the rates of the fundamental steps that underlie aggregate formation from measurements in living systems. In order to address this challenge, here we present a general approach for analysing aggregation kinetics that considers broad classes of processes that can be described by a family of scaling solutions. Our approach is not limited only to fibrillar aggregates, but applies to any aggregate shape. We show that the rates can reliably be extracted by fitting of a simple logistic function, even from experimental data in living systems, and give a very general analytical expression that relates the scaling of the exponential rate with monomer concentration to the microscopic details of the underlying reaction. This approach can thus be used to infer the microscopic mechanism driving the aggregation process from macroscopic measurements in complex systems.},

            Both the replication of protein aggregates and their spreading throughout the brain are implicated in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the rates of these processes are unknown and the identity of the rate-determining process in humans has therefore remained elusive. By bringing together chemical kinetics with measurements of tau seeds and aggregates across brain regions, we can quantify their replication rate in human brains. Notably, we obtain comparable rates in several different datasets, with five different methods of tau quantification, from postmortem seed amplification assays to tau PET studies in living individuals. Our results suggest that from Braak stage III onward, local replication, rather than spreading between brain regions, is the main process controlling the overall rate of accumulation of tau in neocortical regions. The number of seeds doubles only every ∼5 years. Thus, limiting local replication likely constitutes the most promising strategy to control tau accumulation during AD.},

            Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau directly correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease and other primary tauopathies. One therapeutic strategy may be to reduce total tau expression. We identified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that selectively decreased human tau mRNA and protein in mice expressing mutant P301S human tau. After reduction of human tau in this mouse model of tauopathy, fewer tau inclusions developed, and preexisting phosphorylated tau and Thioflavin S pathology were reversed. The resolution of tau pathology was accompanied by the prevention of hippocampal volume loss, neuronal death, and nesting deficits. In addition, mouse survival was extended, and pathological tau seeding was reversed. In nonhuman primates, tau ASOs distributed throughout the brain and spinal cord and reduced tau mRNA and protein in the brain, spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid. These data support investigation of a tau-lowering therapy in human patients who have tau-positive inclusions even after pathological tau deposition has begun.},

	abstract = {The deposition of pathological protein aggregates in the brain plays a central role in cognitive decline and structural damage associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer’s disease, the formation of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of the tau protein is associated with the appearance of symptoms and pathology. Detailed models for the specific mechanisms of aggregate formation, such as nucleation and elongation, exist for aggregation in vitro where the total protein mass is conserved. However, in vivo, an additional class of mechanisms that clear pathological species is present and is believed to play an essential role in limiting the formation of aggregates and preventing or delaying the emergence of disease. A key unanswered question in the field of neuro-degeneration is how these clearance mechanisms can be modeled and how alterations in the processes of clearance or aggregation affect the stability of the system toward aggregation. Here, we generalize classical models of protein aggregation to take into account both production of monomers and the clearance of protein aggregates. We show that, depending on the specifics of the clearance process, a critical clearance value emerges above which accumulation of aggregates does not take place. Our results show that a sudden switch from a healthy to a disease state can be caused by small variations in the efficiency of the clearance process and provide a mathematical framework to explore the detailed effects of different mechanisms of clearance on the accumulation of aggregates.},

	abstract = {Peptides and proteins have been found to possess an inherent tendency to convert from their native functional states into intractable amyloid aggregates. This phenomenon is associated with a range of increasingly common human disorders, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, type II diabetes, and a number of systemic amyloidoses. In this review, we describe this field of science with particular reference to the advances that have been made over the last decade in our understanding of its fundamental nature and consequences. We list the proteins that are known to be deposited as amyloid or other types of aggregates in human tissues and the disorders with which they are associated, as well as the proteins that exploit the amyloid motif to play specific functional roles in humans. In addition, we summarize the genetic factors that have provided insight into the mechanisms of disease onset. We describe recent advances in our knowledge of the structures of amyloid fibrils and their oligomeric precursors and of the mechanisms by which they are formed and proliferate to generate cellular dysfunction. We show evidence that a complex proteostasis network actively combats protein aggregation and that such an efficient system can fail in some circumstances and give rise to disease. Finally, we anticipate the development of novel therapeutic strategies with which to prevent or treat these highly debilitating and currently incurable conditions.},

We present the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of M1-C and show by Small Angle X-Ray Scattering analysis that full-length M1-C folds into an elongated structure that associates laterally into ring-like or filamentous polymers. Using negatively charged giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), we demonstrate that M1-C full-length binds to and induces inward budding of membrane tubules with diameters that resemble the diameter of viruses. Membrane tubule formation requires the C-terminal domain of M1-C, corroborating its essential role for M1-C polymerization. Our results indicate that M1-C assembly on membranes constitutes the driving force for budding and suggest that M1-C plays a key role in facilitating viral egress.},

	abstract = {The aggregation of α-synuclein into amyloid fibrils has been under scrutiny in recent years because of its association with Parkinson’s disease. This process can be triggered by a lipid-dependent nucleation process, and the resulting aggregates can proliferate through secondary nucleation under acidic pH conditions. It has also been recently reported that the aggregation of α-synuclein may follow an alternative pathway, which takes place within dense liquid condensates formed through phase separation. The microscopic mechanism of this process, however, remains to be clarified. Here, we used fluorescence-based assays to enable a kinetic analysis of the microscopic steps underlying the aggregation process of α-synuclein within liquid condensates. Our analysis shows that at pH 7.4, this process starts with spontaneous primary nucleation followed by rapid aggregate-dependent proliferation. Our results thus reveal the microscopic mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation within condensates through the accurate quantification of the kinetic rate constants for the appearance and proliferation of α-synuclein aggregates at physiological pH.},

They also regulate aberrant aggregation of amyloid fibrils, a process linked to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. In the absence of condensates it has been shown that amyloid aggregation can be inhibited by molecular chaperones and rationally designed drugs. However it remains unknown how this drug- or chaperone-mediated inhibition of amyloid fibril aggregation is affected by phase-separated condensates. Here we study the interplay between protein aggregation, its inhibition and liquid-liquid phase separation. Our key finding is that the potency of inhibitors of amyloid formation can be strongly enhanced. We show that the corresponding mechanism relies on the colocalization of inhibitors and aggregates inside the liquid condensate. We provide experimentally testable physicochemical conditions under which the increase of inhibitor potency is most pronounced. Our work highlights the role of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in curtailing aberrant protein aggregation and suggests design principles for amyloid inhibitors accounting for partitioning of drugs into liquid condensates.},

Yet, the mechanisms by which these compartments affect protein aggregation remain unknown. Here, we combine kinetic theory of protein aggregation and liquid-liquid phase separation to study the spatial control of irreversible protein aggregation in the presence of liquid compartments. We find that even for weak interactions aggregates strongly partition into the liquid compartment. Aggregate partitioning is caused by a positive feedback mechanism of aggregate nucleation and growth driven by a flux maintaining the phase equilibrium between the compartment and its surrounding. Our model establishes a link between specific aggregating systems and the physical conditions maximizing aggregate partitioning into the compartment. The underlying mechanism of aggregate partitioning could be used to confine cytotoxic protein aggregates inside droplet-like compartments but may also represent a common mechanism to spatially control irreversible chemical reactions in general.},

Both are essential for the spatial organization of cells and for regulating biological function and dysfunction. A key challenge is understanding the interplay between molecular assembly and phase separation. However, a corresponding theoretical framework that relies on thermodynamic principles is lacking. Here, we present a non-equilibrium thermodynamic theory for a multi-component mixture that contains assemblies of different sizes, which can form, dissolve, and phase-separate from the solvent. We show that the size distributions of assemblies differ between the phases and that the dense phase can gelate. Moreover, we unravel the mechanisms involved in growth and compositional changes of the coexisting phases during assembly kinetics. Our theory can explain how molecular assembly is intertwined with phase separation, and our results are consistent with recent experimental observations on protein phase separation.},

Understanding the process by which the pH-switchable lipids disturb the lipid assembly of nanoparticles and trigger the cargo release is crucial to optimize the rational design of pH-switchable lipids. Here, we gather morphological observations (FF-SEM, Cryo-TEM, AFM, confocal microscopy), physicochemical characterization (DLS, ELS), as well as phase behavior studies (DSC, 2H NMR, Langmuir isotherm, and MAS NMR) to propose a mechanism of pH-triggered membrane destabilization. We demonstrate that the switchable lipids are homogeneously incorporated with other co-lipids (DSPC, cholesterol, and DSPE-PEG2000) and promote a liquid-ordered phase insensitive to temperature variation. Upon acidification, the protonation of the switchable lipids triggers a conformational switch altering the self-assembly properties of lipid nanoparticles. These modifications do not lead to a phase separation of the lipid membrane; however, they cause fluctuations and local defects, which result in morphological changes of the lipid vesicles. These changes are proposed to affect the permeability of vesicle membrane, triggering the release of the cargo encapsulated in the lipid vesicles (LVs). Our results confirm that pH-triggered release does not require major morphological changes, but can result from small defects affecting the lipid membrane permeability.},

	abstract = {Once described as mere “bags of enzymes,” bacterial cells are in fact highly organized, with many macromolecules exhibiting nonuniform localization patterns. Yet the physical and biochemical mechanisms that govern this spatial heterogeneity remain largely unknown. Here, we identify liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a mechanism for organizing clusters of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in Escherichia coli. Using fluorescence imaging, we show that RNAP quickly transitions from a dispersed to clustered localization pattern as cells enter log phase in nutrient-rich media. RNAP clusters are sensitive to hexanediol, a chemical that dissolves liquid-like compartments in eukaryotic cells. In addition, we find that the transcription antitermination factor NusA forms droplets in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that it may nucleate RNAP clusters. Finally, we use single-molecule tracking to characterize the dynamics of cluster components. Our results indicate that RNAP and NusA molecules move inside clusters, with mobilities faster than a DNA locus but slower than bulk diffusion through the nucleoid. We conclude that RNAP clusters are biomolecular condensates that assemble through LLPS. This work provides direct evidence for LLPS in bacteria and demonstrates that this process can serve as a mechanism for intracellular organization in prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike.},

Here, we demonstrate that the concentration of tubulin into a condensed, liquid-like compartment composed of the unstructured neuronal protein tau is sufﬁcient to nucleate microtubule bundles. We show that, under conditions of macro-molecular crowding, tau forms liquid-like drops. Tubulin partitions into these drops, efﬁciently increasing tubulin concentration and driving the nucleation of microtubules. These growing microtubules form bundles, which deform the drops while remaining enclosed by diffusible tau molecules exhibiting a liquid-like behavior. Our data suggest that condensed compartments of microtubule bundling proteins could promote the local formation of microtubule bundles in neurons by acting as non-centrosomal microtubule nucleation centers and that liquid-like tau encapsulation could provide both stability and plasticity to long axonal microtubule bundles.},

A central problem in cellular control is how cells cope with this inherent noise. Compartmentalization of proteins through phase separation has been suggested as a potential mechanism to reduce noise, but systematic studies to support this idea have been missing. In this study, we used a physical model that links noise in protein concentration to theory of phase separation to show that liquid droplets can effectively reduce noise. We provide experimental support for noise reduction by phase separation using engineered proteins that form liquid-like compartments in mammalian cells. Thus, phase separation can play an important role in biological signal processing and control.},

Copolymerisation has been studied theoretically in a number of contexts, often by considering a Markov process in which monomers are added or removed from the growing tip of a long copolymer. To date, the analysis of the most general models of this class has necessitated simulation. We present a general method for analysing such processes without resorting to simulation. Our method can be applied to models with an arbitrary network of sub-steps prior to addition or removal of a monomer, including non-equilibrium kinetic proofreading cycles. Moreover, the approach allows for a dependency of addition and removal reactions on the neighbouring site in the copolymer, and thermodynamically self-consistent models in which all steps are assumed to be microscopically reversible. Using our approach, thermodynamic quantities such as chemical work; kinetic quantities such as time taken to grow; and statistical quantities such as the distribution of monomer types in the growing copolymer can be derived either analytically or numerically directly from the model definition.},

A logical answer was the postulate of metabolic channeling, which in its simplest embodiment assumes that the product generated by one enzyme passes directly to a second without diffusion into the surrounding medium. This tight coupling of activities might increase a pathway’s metabolic flux and/or serve to sequester unstable/toxic/reactive intermediates as well as prevent their access to other networks. Here, we present evidence for this concept, commencing with enzymes that feature a physical molecular tunnel, to multi-enzyme complexes that retain pathway substrates through electrostatics or enclosures, and finally to metabolons that feature collections of enzymes assembled into clusters with variable stoichiometric composition. Lastly, we discuss the advantages of reversibly assembled metabolons in the context of the purinosome, the purine biosynthesis metabolon.},

Biochemical mechanisms underlying such regulation include the potential for concentrating reactants together, tuning reaction rates, and controlling competing metabolic pathways. LLPS is thus a powerful tool with extensive utilities at the cell's disposal, e.g. for consolidating cell survival under stress or rerouting metabolic pathways in response to the energy state of the cell.

	abstract = {Metabolism is the sum of the life-giving chemical processes that occur within a cell. Proper regulation of these processes is essential for all organisms to thrive and prosper. When external factors are too extreme, or if internal regulation is corrupted through genetic or epigenetic changes, metabolic homeostasis is no longer achievable and diseases such as metabolic syndrome or cancer, aging, and, ultimately, death ensue. Metabolic reactions are catalyzed by proteins, and the in vitro kinetic properties of these enzymes have been studied by biochemists for many decades. These efforts led to the appreciation that enzyme activities can be acutely regulated and that this regulation is critical to metabolic homeostasis. Regulation can be mediated through allosteric interactions with metabolites themselves or via post-translational modifications triggered by intracellular signal transduction pathways. More recently, enzyme regulation has attracted the attention of cell biologists who noticed that change in growth conditions often triggers the condensation of diffusely localized enzymes into one or more discrete foci, easily visible by light microscopy. This reorganization from a soluble to a condensed state is best described as a phase separation. As summarized in this review, stimulus-induced phase separation has now been observed for dozens of enzymes suggesting that this could represent a widespread mode of activity regulation, rather than, or in addition to, a storage form of temporarily superfluous enzymes. Building on our recent structure determination of TOROIDs (TORc1 Organized in Inhibited Domain), the condensate formed by the protein kinase Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1), we will highlight that the molecular organization of enzyme condensates can vary dramatically and that future work aimed at the structural characterization of enzyme condensates will be critical to understand how phase separation regulates enzyme activity and consequently metabolic homeostasis. This information may ultimately facilitate the design of strategies to target the assembly or disassembly of specific enzymes condensates as a therapeutic approach to restore metabolic homeostasis in certain diseases.},

When ≈800 yeast strains expressing GFP-tagged proteins were grown to stationary phase, a surprising number of proteins involved in intermediary metabolism and stress response were observed to form punctate cytoplasmic foci. The formation of these discrete physical structures was confirmed by immunofluorescence and mass spectrometry of untagged proteins. The purine biosynthetic enzyme Ade4-GFP formed foci in the absence of adenine, and cycling between punctate and diffuse phenotypes could be controlled by adenine subtraction and addition. Similarly, glutamine synthetase (Gln1-GFP) foci cycled reversibly in the absence and presence of glucose. The structures were neither targeted for vacuolar or autophagosome degradation nor colocalized with P bodies or major organelles. Thus, upon nutrient depletion we observe widespread protein assemblies displaying nutrient-specific formation and dissolution.},

We find that hypoxia in Saccharomyces cerevisiae induces concentration of glycolytic enzymes, including the Pfk2p subunit of the rate-limiting phosphofructokinase, into a single, non-membrane-bound granule termed the “glycolytic body” or “G body.” A yeast kinome screen identifies the yeast ortholog of AMP-activated protein kinase, Snf1p, as necessary for G-body formation. Many G-body components identified by proteomics are required for G-body integrity. Cells incapable of forming G bodies in hypoxia display abnormal cell division and produce inviable daughter cells. Conversely, cells with G bodies show increased glucose consumption and decreased levels of glycolytic intermediates. Importantly, G bodies form in human hepatocarcinoma cells in hypoxia. Together, our results suggest that G body formation is a conserved, adaptive response to increase glycolytic output during hypoxia or tumorigenesis.},

In enrichment inhibition, the enzyme enriches in the condensate and weakens interactions, as seen in stress granules (SGs), Cajal bodies, and P granules. In localization-induction, condensates form around immobilized enzymes that strengthen interactions, as observed in DNA repair, transmembrane signaling, and microtubule assembly.

These interfaces exhibit a complex interplay between elasticity, low Reynolds number interfacial hydrodynamics, chemistry and geometry, and govern important biological processes such as cellular traffic, division, migration or tissue morphogenesis. To address the modelling challenges posed by this class of problems, in which interfacial phenomena tightly interact with the shape and dynamics of the surface, we develop a general continuum mechanics and computational framework for fluid deformable surfaces. The dual solid–fluid nature of fluid deformable surfaces challenges classical Lagrangian or Eulerian descriptions of deforming bodies. Here, we extend the notion of arbitrarily Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) formulations, well-established for bulk media, to deforming surfaces. To systematically develop models for fluid deformable surfaces, which consistently treat all couplings between fields and geometry, we follow a nonlinear Onsager formalism according to which the dynamics minimizes a Rayleighian functional where dissipation, power input and energy release rate compete. Finally, we propose new computational methods, which build on Onsager’s formalism and our ALE formulation, to deal with the resulting stiff system of higher-order partial differential equations. We apply our theoretical and computational methodology to classical models for lipid bilayers and the cell cortex. The methods developed here allow us to formulate/simulate these models in their full three-dimensional generality, accounting for finite curvatures and finite shape changes.},

Here, we observe and model mathematically an unexpected fundamental mechanism by which particles suspended within stratification may self-assemble and form large aggregates without adhesion. This phenomenon arises through a complex interplay involving solute diffusion, impermeable boundaries, and aggregate geometry, which produces toroidal flows. We show that these flows yield attractive horizontal forces between particles at the same heights. We observe that many particles demonstrate a collective motion revealing a system which appears to solve jigsaw-like puzzles on its way to organizing into a large-scale disc-like shape, with the effective force increasing as the collective disc radius grows. Control experiments isolate the individual dynamics, which are quantitatively predicted by simulations. Numerical force calculations with two spheres are used to build many-body simulations which capture observed features of self-assembly., Aggregation of matter, common in stratified fluid systems, is essential to the carbon cycle and ocean ecology. Although the current understanding of aggregation involves only collision and adhesion, here Camassa et al. reveal a self-assembly phenomenon arising solely from diffusion-induced flows.},

	abstract = {Many lipid membranes of eukaryotic cells are asymmetric, which means the two leaflets differ in at least one physical property, such as lipid composition or lateral stress. Maintaining this asymmetry is helped by the fact that ordinary phospholipids rarely transition between leaflets, but cholesterol is an exception: its flip-flop times are in the microsecond range, so that its distribution between leaflets is determined by a chemical equilibrium. In particular, preferential partitioning can draw cholesterol into a more saturated leaflet, and phospholipid number asymmetry can force it out of a compressed leaflet. Combining highly coarse-grained membrane simulations with theoretical modeling, we investigate how these two driving forces play against each other until cholesterol’s chemical potential is equilibrated. The theory includes two coupled elastic sheets and a Flory-Huggins mixing free energy with a χ parameter. We obtain a relationship between χ and the interaction strength between cholesterol and lipids in either of the two leaflets, and we find that it depends, albeit weakly, on lipid number asymmetry. The differential stress measurements under various asymmetry conditions agree with our theoretical predictions. Using the two kinds of asymmetries in combination, we find that it is possible to counteract the phospholipid number bias, and the resultant stress in the membrane, via the control of cholesterol mixing in the leaflets.},

For years physicists, mathematicians, materials scientists and cell biologists have studied a possible universal effect — attraction between proteins that is induced solely by membrane curvature. But the nature of membrane-curvature-induced interactions between proteins, and even the question of whether they are attractive or repulsive, remained obscure. Now computer simulations reveal that curvature-induced interactions can indeed be attractive, strong, and robust. Well up to the task of effecting membrane remodelling.

	abstract = {Cells are populated by a vast array of membrane-binding proteins that execute critical functions. Functions, like signaling and intracellular transport, require the abilities to bind to highly curved membranes and to trigger membrane deformation. Among these proteins is amphiphysin 1, implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It contains a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs membrane-binding domain with an N-terminal amphipathic helix that senses and generates membrane curvature. However, an understanding of the parameters distinguishing these two functions is missing. By pulling a highly curved nanotube of controlled radius from a giant vesicle in a solution containing amphiphysin, we observed that the action of the protein depends directly on its density on the membrane. At low densities of protein on the nearly flat vesicle, the distribution of proteins and the mechanical effects induced are described by a model based on spontaneous curvature induction. The tube radius and force are modified by protein binding but still depend on membrane tension. In the dilute limit, when practically no proteins were present on the vesicle, no mechanical effects were detected, but strong protein enrichment proportional to curvature was seen on the tube. At high densities, the radius is independent of tension and vesicle protein density, resulting from the formation of a scaffold around the tube. As a consequence, the scaling of the force with tension is modified. For the entire density range, protein was enriched on the tube as compared to the vesicle. Our approach shows that the strength of curvature sensing and mechanical effects on the tube depends on the protein density.},

Their structure reveals distinct long linear aggregates of proteins, regularly spaced by up to 300 nm. Employing accurate free-energy calculations from large-scale coarse-grained computer simulations, we found that the membrane mediates the interaction among protein filaments as a combination of short- and long-ranged interactions. The long-ranged component acts at strikingly long distances, giving rise to a variety of micron-sized ordered patterns.

Euler-Lagrange equations are derived for the shape in magnetic fields and under excess outside pressure. It is shown that magnetic fields can deform spherical vesicles into ellipsoids of revolution.

Effective membrane shaping requires segregation of these proteins into domains and is, therefore, critically dependent on the protein-protein interaction. Interactions mediated by membrane elastic deformations have been extensively analyzed within approximations of large inter-protein distances, small extents of the protein-mediated membrane bending and small deviations of the protein shapes from isotropic spherical segments. At the same time, important classes of the realistic membrane-shaping proteins have strongly elongated shapes with large and highly anisotropic curvature. Here we investigated, computationally, the membrane mediated interaction between proteins or protein oligomers representing membrane scaffolds with strongly anisotropic curvature, and addressed, quantitatively, a specific case of the scaffold geometrical parameters characterizing BAR domains, which are crucial for membrane shaping in endocytosis. In addition to the previously analyzed contributions to the interaction, we considered a repulsive force stemming from the entropy of the scaffold orientation. We computed this interaction to be of the same order of magnitude as the well-known attractive force related to the entropy of membrane undulations. We demonstrated the scaffold shape anisotropy to cause a mutual aligning of the scaffolds and to generate a strong attractive interaction bringing the scaffolds close to each other to equilibrium distances much smaller than the scaffold size. We computed the energy of interaction between scaffolds of a realistic geometry to constitute tens of kBT, which guarantees a robust segregation of the scaffolds into domains.},

	abstract = {Equilibrium states of a closed semiflexible polymer binding to a cylinder are described. This may be either by confinement or by constriction. Closed completely bound states are labeled by two integers: the number of oscillations, n, and the number of times it winds the cylinder, p, the latter being a topological invariant. We examine the behavior of these states as the length of the loop is increased by evaluating the energy, the conserved axial torque, and the contact force. The ground state for a given p is the state with n=1; a short loop with p=1 is an elliptic deformation of a parallel circle; as its length increases it elongates along the cylinder axis with two hairpin ends. Excited states with n≥2 and p=1 possess n-fold axial symmetry. Short (long) loops possess energies ≈pE0(nE0), with E0 the energy of a circular loop with same radius as the cylinder; in long loops the axial torque vanishes. Confined bound excited states are initially unstable; however, above a critical length each n-fold state becomes stable: The folded hairpin cannot be unfolded. The ground state for each p is also initially unstable with respect to deformations rotating the loop off the surface into the interior. A closed planar elastic curve aligned along the cylinder axis making contact with the cylinder on its two sides is identified as the ground state of a confined loop. Exterior bound states behave very differently, if free to unbind, as signaled by the reversal in the sign of the contact force. If p=1, all such states are unstable. If p≥2, however, a topological obstruction to complete unbinding exists. If the loop is short, the bound state with p=2 and n=1 provides a stable constriction of the cylinder, partially unbinding as the length is increased. This motif could be relevant to an understanding of the process of membrane fission mediated by dynamin rings.},

This phenomenon depends on initial template shape and involves the co-existence and progressive transition between distinct local states in terms of molecular organization (protein arrangement and density) and membrane shape (template size and spherical versus cylindrical curvature). Further, we demonstrate in cells that this phenomenon enables a mechanotransduction mode, in which cellular stretch leads to the mechanical formation of membrane templates, which are then reshaped into tubules by BAR proteins. Our results demonstrate the interplay between membrane mechanics and BAR protein molecular organization, integrating curvature sensing and generation in a comprehensive framework with implications for cell mechanical responses.},

Here we demonstrate the effect of Dantu on the ability of the merozoite form of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to invade red blood cells (RBCs). We find that Dantu is associated with extensive changes to the repertoire of proteins found on the RBC surface, but, unexpectedly, inhibition of invasion does not correlate with specific RBC–parasite receptor–ligand interactions. By following invasion using video microscopy, we find a strong link between RBC tension and merozoite invasion, and identify a tension threshold above which invasion rarely occurs, even in non-Dantu RBCs. Dantu RBCs have higher average tension than non-Dantu RBCs, meaning that a greater proportion resist invasion. These findings provide both an explanation for the protective effect of Dantu, and fresh insight into why the efficiency of P. falciparum invasion might vary across the heterogenous populations of RBCs found both within and between individuals.},

	abstract = {Chemotaxis of enzymes in response to gradients in the concentration of their substrate has been widely reported in recent experiments, but a basic understanding of the process is still lacking. Here, we develop a microscopic theory for chemotaxis that is valid for enzymes and other small molecules. Our theory includes both nonspecific interactions between enzyme and substrate as well as complex formation through specific binding between the enzyme and the substrate. We find that two distinct mechanisms contribute to enzyme chemotaxis: a diffusiophoretic mechanism due to the nonspecific interactions and a new type of mechanism due to binding-induced changes in the diffusion coefficient of the enzyme. The latter chemotactic mechanism points toward lower substrate concentration if the substrate enhances enzyme diffusion and toward higher substrate concentration if the substrate inhibits enzyme diffusion. For a typical enzyme, attractive phoresis and binding-induced enhanced diffusion will compete against each other. We find that phoresis dominates above a critical substrate concentration, whereas binding-induced enhanced diffusion dominates for low substrate concentration. Our results resolve an apparent contradiction regarding the direction of urease chemotaxis observed in experiments and, in general, clarify the relation between the enhanced diffusion and the chemotaxis of enzymes. Finally, we show that the competition between the two distinct chemotactic mechanisms may be used to engineer nanomachines that move toward or away from regions with a specific substrate concentration.},

The BAR domain bends the biomembrane along the rod axis and the features of this anisotropic bending have recently been studied. Here, we report on the role of the BAR protein rods in inducing membrane tubulation, using large-scale coarse-grained simulations. We reveal that a small spontaneous side curvature perpendicular to the rod can drastically alter the tubulation dynamics at high protein density, whereas no significant difference is obtained at low density. A percolated network is intermediately formed depending on the side curvature. This network suppresses tubule protrusion, leading to the slow formation of fewer tubules. Thus, the side curvature, which is generated by protein–protein and membrane–protein interactions, plays a significant role in tubulation dynamics. We also find that positive surface tensions and the vesicle membrane curvature can stabilize this network structure by suppressing the tubulation.},

Dry, aligning, dilute, active matter (DADAM), with its many adjectives, refers to a corner of the multidimensional, fast-growing field of active matter studies. This corner, however, has both historical and theoretical importance for the entire field. These lectures notes first describe this particular status of DADAM. We then provide an overview of our current knowledge of DADAM in a synthetic and coherent manner. This constitutes the bulk of these notes. For convenience, we first describe the phenomenology of simple active particle models representing the basic DADAM classes, limiting ourselves to two spatial dimensions, where most work has been performed. Then we discuss the continuous hydrodynamic theories derived from these models using the Boltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau approach. We show in particular that they are largely faithful to the microscopic level, albeit qualitatively. In the conclusion, we come back to the nodal situation of DADAM within active matter studies and provide perspectives on how one can expand DADAM knowledge into various directions, approaching more realistic and more complex situations in a controlled way.},

This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: New effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge.

This review describes two-dimensional electrophoretic techniques that can be used to separate membrane proteins.

              The healthy growth and maintenance of a biological system depends on the precise spatial organization of molecules within the cell through the dissipation of energy. Reaction–diffusion mechanisms can facilitate this organization, as can directional cargo transport orchestrated by motor proteins, by relying on specific protein interactions. However, transport of material through the cell can also be achieved by active processes based on non-specific, purely physical mechanisms, a phenomenon that remains poorly explored. Here, using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we discover and describe a hidden function of the
              Escherichia coli
              MinDE protein system: in addition to forming dynamic patterns, this system accomplishes the directional active transport of functionally unrelated cargo on membranes. Remarkably, this mechanism enables the sorting of diffusive objects according to their effective size, as evidenced using modular DNA origami–streptavidin nanostructures. We show that the diffusive fluxes of MinDE and non-specific cargo couple via density-dependent friction. This non-specific process constitutes a diffusiophoretic mechanism, as yet unknown in a cell biology setting. This nonlinear coupling between diffusive fluxes could represent a generic physical mechanism for establishing intracellular organization.},

              Cell membranes interact with a myriad of curvature-active proteins that control membrane morphology and are responsible for mechanosensation and mechanotransduction. Some of these proteins, such as those containing BAR domains, are curved and elongated, and hence may adopt different states of orientational order, from isotropic to maximize entropy to nematic as a result of crowding or to adapt to the curvature of the underlying membrane. Here, extending the classical work of Onsager for ordering in hard particle systems and that of [E. S. Nascimento

This theory depends on the microscopic properties of the particles and explains how a density-dependent isotropic-to-nematic transition is modified by anisotropic curvature. We also examine the coexistence of isotropic and nematic phases. This theory predicts how ordering depends on geometry but we assume here that the geometry is fixed. It also lays the ground to understand the interplay between membrane reshaping by BAR proteins and molecular order, examined by [Le Roux

This crucial step is somehow accomplished by proteins from the dynamin family, which polymerize into helical spirals around such necks. Much research has been devoted to elucidating the specifics of that somehow, but despite no shortage of ideas, the question is not settled. Pictorially obvious notions of strangling or pushing are difficult to render in mechanically precise terms. Moreover, because dynamin is a GTPase, it is tempting to speculate that it has a motor activity that assists the necessary severing action, but again the underlying mechanics is not obvious. We believe the difficulty to be the mechanically nontrivial nature of confining elastic filaments onto curved surfaces, for which efficient methods to conceptualize the associated forces and torques have only recently appeared. Here we investigate the implications of a conceptually simple yet mechanically challenging model: consider an elastic helical filament confined to a surface mimicking the neck between two membrane compartments, which we assume to take the shape of a catenoid. What can we say about the expected length of such adsorbed filaments, their shapes, and the forces they exert, as a function of the key parameters in the model? While real dynamin is surely more complex, we consider such a minimal model to be the indispensable baseline. Without knowing what such a model can and cannot explain, it is difficult to justify more complex mechanisms, or understand the constraints under which this machinery evolved in the first place.},

However, beyond a critical radius Rc \% hhm/(2hc) (h, bilayer thickness; hm/c, viscosity of the membrane/surrounding solvent) we observe signiﬁcant deviations and the emergence of an asymptotic scaling D ; 1/R2. The latter originates from the asymptotic hydrodynamics and the inclusion’s internal degrees of freedom that become particularly relevant on short timescales.

	abstract = {In the study of fluid dynamics and transport phenomena, key quantities of interest are often the force and torque on objects and total rate of heat/mass transfer from them. Conventionally, these integrated quantities are determined by first solving the governing equations for the detailed distribution of the field variables (i.e. velocity, pressure, temperature, concentration, etc.) and then integrating the variables or their derivatives on the surface of the objects. On the other hand, the divergence form of the conservation equations opens the door for establishing integral identities that can be used for directly calculating the integrated quantities without requiring the detailed knowledge of the distribution of the primary variables. This shortcut approach constitutes the idea of the reciprocal theorem, whose closest relative is Green’s second identity, which readers may recall from studies of partial differential equations. Despite its importance and practicality, the theorem may not be so familiar to many in the research community. Ironically, some believe that the extreme simplicity and generality of the theorem are responsible for suppressing its application! In this Perspectives piece, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the concept and application of the reciprocal theorem, with the hope of facilitating its use. Specifically, a brief history on the development of the theorem is given as a background, followed by the discussion of the main ideas in the context of elementary boundary-value problems. After that, we demonstrate how the reciprocal theorem can be utilized to solve fundamental problems in low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, acoustics and heat/mass transfer, including convection. Throughout the article, we strive to make the materials accessible to early career researchers while keeping it interesting for more experienced scientists and engineers.},

An appealing alternative to traditional computational approaches is to employ simpler, continuum-based models developed within the frameworks of elasticity theory, ﬂuid dynamics, and statistical mechanics. Although such models have seen wide use in analytical descriptions of membrane behavior, the extension of these methods to more general situations and numerical analysis is just beginning to be explored. This article reviews continuum models for membrane behavior with an emphasis on the use of such models in computational studies.

            Lipid bilayers constitute the matrix of cellular membranes and synthetic vesicles used in drug delivery. This self-assembled structure is only a few nanometers thick but provides an effective barrier between aqueous fluids. The response of lipid bilayers to shear stresses induced by surrounding fluid flows can trigger biophysical processes in cells and influence the efficacy of drug delivery by synthetic vesicles. Here, we use optical tweezers to apply and measure local hydrodynamic shear stresses on both sides of a freestanding lipid bilayer. With this method, we determine the rheological properties of bilayers and capture a previously unreported phenomenon when the intermonolayer friction is so low that the monolayers slip past each other and hydrodynamic shear is not transmitted through the bilayer.
          , 
            Vital biological processes, such as trafficking, sensing, and motility, are facilitated by cellular lipid membranes, which interact mechanically with surrounding fluids. Such lipid membranes are only a few nanometers thick and composed of a liquid crystalline structure known as the lipid bilayer. Here, we introduce an active, noncontact, two-point microrheology technique combining multiple optical tweezers probes with planar freestanding lipid bilayers accessible on both sides. We use the method to quantify both fluid slip close to the bilayer surface and transmission of fluid flow across the structure, and we use numerical simulations to determine the monolayer viscosity and the intermonolayer friction. We find that these physical properties are highly dependent on the molecular structure of the lipids in the bilayer. We compare ordered-phase with liquid disordered-phase lipid bilayers, and we find the ordered-phase bilayers to be 10 to 100 times more viscous but with 100 times less intermonolayer friction. When a local shear is applied by the optical tweezers, the ultralow intermonolayer friction results in full slip of the two leaflets relative to each other and as a consequence, no shear transmission across the membrane. Our study sheds light on the physical principles governing the transfer of shear forces by and through lipid membranes, which underpin cell behavior and homeostasis.},

            Biological cells contain large numbers of active proteins that repeatedly change their conformations and need a supply of ATP or other substrates to maintain their cyclic operation. Whereas these protein machines have a variety of specific functions, acting as motors, ion pumps, or enzymes, they also induce fluctuating hydrodynamic flows in the cytoplasm. Because such fluctuating flows are nonthermal, energy can be extracted from them and work can be performed. We show that these flows can substantially enhance diffusive motions of passive particles. Furthermore, when gradients in concentrations of active proteins or substrate (ATP) are present, a chemotaxis-like drift should take place. Such nonequilibrium effects are universal: They hold for all passive particles and also for the protein machines themselves.

            The cytoplasm and biomembranes in biological cells contain large numbers of proteins that cyclically change their shapes. They are molecular machines that can function as molecular motors or carry out various other tasks in the cell. Many enzymes also undergo conformational changes within their turnover cycles. We analyze the advection effects that nonthermal fluctuating hydrodynamic flows induced by active proteins have on other passive molecules in solution or membranes. We show that the diffusion constants of passive particles are enhanced substantially. Furthermore, when gradients of active proteins are present, a chemotaxis-like drift of passive particles takes place. In lipid bilayers, the effects are strongly nonlocal, so that active inclusions in the entire membrane contribute to local diffusion enhancement and the drift. All active proteins in a biological cell or in a membrane contribute to such effects and all passive particles, and the proteins themselves, will be subject to them.},

On gel-state membranes or after mutation of residues along the lateral interaction surface, F-BARs adsorb onto bilayers via surfaces other than their concave face. We conclude that membrane binding is separable from membrane bending, and that imposition of the module's concave surface forces fluid-phase bilayers to bend locally. Furthermore, exposure of the domain's lateral interaction surface through a change in orientation serves as the crucial trigger for assembly of the helical coat and propagation of bilayer bending. The geometric constraints and sequential assembly of the helical lattice explain how F-BAR and classical BAR domains segregate into distinct microdomains, and provide insight into the spatial regulation of membrane invagination.},

            Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs superfamily proteins and other curvature-inducing proteins have anisotropic shapes and anisotropically bend biomembranes. Here, we report how the anisotropic proteins bind the membrane tube and are orientationally ordered using mean-field theory including an orientation-dependent excluded volume. The proteins exhibit a second-order or first-order nematic transition with increasing protein density depending on the radius of the membrane tube. The tube curvatures for the maximum protein binding and orientational order are different and varied by the protein density and rigidity. As the external force along the tube axis increases, a first-order transition from a large tube radius with low protein density to a small radius with high density occurs once, and subsequently, the protein orientation tilts to the tube-axis direction. When an isotropic bending energy is used for the proteins with an elliptic shape, the force-dependence curves become symmetric and the first-order transition occurs twice. This theory quantitatively reproduces the results of meshless membrane simulation for short proteins, whereas deviations are seen for long proteins owing to the formation of protein clusters.},

We focus on the tetris artificial spin-ice structure, a highly frustrated array geometry with a zero-point Pauling entropy, which is formed by selectively creating regular vacancies on the canonical square ice lattice. We probe thermally active tetris artificial spin ice both experimentally and through simulations, measuring the magnetic moments of the individual nanomagnets. We find two-dimensional magnetic ordering in one subset of these moments, which we demonstrate to be induced by disorder (that is, increased entropy) in another subset of the moments. In contrast with other entropy-driven systems, the discrete degrees of freedom in tetris artificial spin ice are binary and are both designable and directly observable at the microscale, and the entropy of the system is precisely calculable in simulations. This example, in which the system’s interactions and ground-state entropy are well defined, expands the experimental landscape for the study of entropy-driven ordering.},

In addition we show that increasing the degree of channeling may lead to an increase of the metabolite pool size.

In particular, we show that demixed domains are likely to segregate when the variance in the intermolecular interaction strengths exceeds a well-deﬁned threshold. Multiple distinct phases are likely to become stable under very similar conditions, which can then be tuned to achieve multiphase coexistence. As a result, only minor adjustments to the composition of the cytosol or the strengths of the intermolecular interactions are needed to regulate the formation of different domains with speciﬁc compositions, implying that phase separation is a robust mechanism for creating spatial organization. We further predict that this functionality is only weakly affected by increasing the number of components in the system. Our model therefore suggests that, for purely physico-chemical reasons, biological mixtures are naturally poised to undergo a small number of demixing phase transitions.},

            Cells are compartmentalized to allow distinct processes to occur in membrane-delimited organelles. But similar spatial restriction of cellular components in membrane-less intracellular assemblies or condensates also appears to occur—much like oil droplets in water. These compartments contribute to multiple biological processes and regulatory mechanisms. Shin and Brangwynne review the protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions that result in formation of these structures. They explain known and potential functions of such structures in a range of examples, from signaling and local control of biochemical reactants to spatial segregation. In disease, such aggregation may go awry and contribute to neurodegenerative syndromes associated with inappropriate protein aggregation.

              BACKGROUND
              Living cells contain distinct subcompartments to facilitate spatiotemporal regulation of biological reactions. In addition to canonical membrane-bound organelles such as secretory vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, there are many organelles that do not have an enclosing membrane yet remain coherent structures that can compartmentalize and concentrate specific sets of molecules. Examples include assemblies in the nucleus such as the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, and nuclear speckles and also cytoplasmic structures such as stress granules, P-bodies, and germ granules. These structures play diverse roles in various biological processes and are also increasingly implicated in protein aggregation diseases.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              A number of studies have shown that membrane-less assemblies exhibit remarkable liquid-like features. As with conventional liquids, they typically adopt round morphologies and coalesce into a single droplet upon contact with one another and also wet intracellular surfaces such as the nuclear envelope. Moreover, component molecules exhibit dynamic exchange with the surrounding nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. These findings together suggest that these structures represent liquid-phase condensates, which form via a biologically regulated (liquid-liquid) phase separation process. Liquid phase condensation increasingly appears to be a fundamental mechanism for organizing intracellular space. Consistent with this concept, several membrane-less organelles have been shown to exhibit a concentration threshold for assembly, a hallmark of phase separation. At the molecular level, weak, transient interactions between molecules with multivalent domains or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are a driving force for phase separation. In cells, condensation of liquid-phase assemblies can be regulated by active processes, including transcription and various posttranslational modifications. The simplest physical picture of a homogeneous liquid phase is often not enough to capture the full complexity of intracellular condensates, which frequently exhibit heterogeneous multilayered structures with partially solid-like characters. However, recent studies have shown that multiple distinct liquid phases can coexist and give rise to richly structured droplet architectures determined by the relative liquid surface tensions. Moreover, solid-like phases can emerge from metastable liquid condensates via multiple routes of potentially both kinetic and thermodynamic origins, which has important implications for the role of intracellular liquids in protein aggregation pathologies.
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              The list of intracellular assemblies driven by liquid phase condensation is growing rapidly, but our understanding of their sequence-encoded biological function and dysfunction lags behind. Moreover, unlike equilibrium phases of nonliving matter, living cells are far from equilibrium, with intracellular condensates subject to various posttranslational regulation and other adenosine triphosphate–dependent biological activity. Efforts using in vitro reconstitution, combined with traditional cell biology approaches and quantitative biophysical tools, are required to elucidate how such nonequilibrium features of living cells control intracellular phase behavior. The functional consequences of forming liquid condensates are likely multifaceted and may include facilitated reaction, sequestration of specific factors, and organization of associated intracellular structures. Liquid phase condensation is particularly interesting in the nucleus, given the growing interest in the impact of nuclear phase behavior on the flow of genetic information; nuclear condensates range from micrometer-sized bodies such as the nucleolus to submicrometer structures such as transcriptional assemblies, all of which directly interact with and regulate the genome. Deepening our understanding of these intracellular states of matter not only will shed light on the basic biology of cellular organization but also may enable therapeutic intervention in protein aggregation disease by targeting intracellular phase behavior.
              
                
                  Liquid phase condensation: An emerging paradigm of cellular organization.
                  Living cells contain various types of condensed liquid-like structures enriched with a distinct set of biomolecules that assemble through regulated phase separation. Sequence-encoded physicochemical properties lead to rich intracellular phase behaviors, including multiphase structuring and emergence of solid-like states from metastable liquids. Liquid condensates affect the flow of information in the cell, often through affecting RNA transcription and protein translation.
                
                
              
            
          , 
            Phase transitions are ubiquitous in nonliving matter, and recent discoveries have shown that they also play a key role within living cells. Intracellular liquid-liquid phase separation is thought to drive the formation of condensed liquid-like droplets of protein, RNA, and other biomolecules, which form in the absence of a delimiting membrane. Recent studies have elucidated many aspects of the molecular interactions underlying the formation of these remarkable and ubiquitous droplets and the way in which such interactions dictate their material properties, composition, and phase behavior. Here, we review these exciting developments and highlight key remaining challenges, particularly the ability of liquid condensates to both facilitate and respond to biological function and how their metastability may underlie devastating protein aggregation diseases.},

	abstract = {Snails are model organisms for studying the genetic, molecular, and developmental bases of left–right asymmetry in Bilateria. However, the development of their typical helicospiral shell, present for the last 540 million years in environments as different as the abyss or our gardens, remains poorly understood. Conversely, ammonites typically have a bilaterally symmetric, planispiraly coiled shell, with only 1\% of 3,000 genera displaying either a helicospiral or a meandering asymmetric shell. A comparative analysis suggests that the development of chiral shells in these mollusks is different and that, unlike snails, ammonites with asymmetric shells probably had a bilaterally symmetric body diagnostic of cephalopods. We propose a mathematical model for the growth of shells, taking into account the physical interaction during development between the soft mollusk body and its hard shell. Our model shows that a growth mismatch between the secreted shell tube and a bilaterally symmetric body in ammonites can generate mechanical forces that are balanced by a twist of the body, breaking shell symmetry. In gastropods, where a twist is intrinsic to the body, the same model predicts that helicospiral shells are the most likely shell forms. Our model explains a large diversity of forms and shows that, although molluscan shells are incrementally secreted at their opening, the path followed by the shell edge and the resulting form are partly governed by the mechanics of the body inside the shell, a perspective that explains many aspects of their development and evolution.},

How the interplay of local differential tensions with tissue geometry and with external forces results in tissue-scale morphogenesis remains an open question. Here, we describe epithelial sheets as active viscoelastic surfaces and study their deformation under patterned internal tensions and bending moments. In addition to isotropic effects, we take into account nematic alignment in the plane of the tissue, which gives rise to shape-dependent, anisotropic active tensions and bending moments. We present phase diagrams of the mechanical equilibrium shapes of pre-patterned closed shells and explore their dynamical deformations. Our results show that a combination of nematic alignment and gradients in internal tensions and bending moments is sufficient to reproduce basic building blocks of epithelial morphogenesis, including fold formation, budding, neck formation, flattening, and tubulation.},

Although the three variants of the MARTINI model provide consistent descriptions for the protein-protein interface in a linear ﬁlament model of ESCRT-III, they differ considerably in terms of protein-membrane interface and therefore membrane curvature sensing and generation behaviors. In particular, BMW-MARTINI provides the most consistent description of the protein-membrane interface as compared to all-atom simulations, whereas the regular MARTINI is most consistent with atomistic simulations in terms of the qualitative sign of membrane curvature sensing and generation. With POL-MARTINI, the ESCRT-III model interacts weakly with the membrane and therefore does not exhibit any curvature-sensitive activities. Analysis suggests that the incorrect membrane curvature activities predicted by BMW-MARTINI are due to overestimated insertion depth of an amphipathic helix and incorrect sign for the spontaneous curvature of anionic lipids. These results not only point to ways that coarse-grained models can be improved but also explicitly highlight local lipid composition and insertion depth of protein motifs as essential regulatory factors for membrane curvature sensing and generation.},

To understand how this machinery works, we directly correlated ﬂuorescence microscopy of key protein pairs with electron tomography. We systematically located 211 endocytic intermediates, assigned each to a speciﬁc time window in endocytosis, and reconstructed their ultrastructure in 3D. The resulting virtual ultrastructural movie deﬁnes the protein-mediated membrane shape changes during endocytosis in budding yeast. It reveals that clathrin is recruited to ﬂat membranes and does not initiate curvature. Instead, membrane invagination begins upon actin network assembly followed by amphiphysin binding to parallel membrane segments, which promotes elongation of the invagination into a tubule. Scission occurs on average 9 s after initial bending when invaginations are  100 nm deep, releasing nonspherical vesicles with 6,400 nm2 mean surface area. Direct correlation of protein dynamics with ultrastructure provides a quantitative 4D resource.},

This recent quantitative physical description of biological systems has profoundly advanced our understanding of life, which is shifting from a descriptive to a predictive level. Like other active materials investigated in condensed matter physics, biological materials still pose great challenges to modern physics as they form a specific class of nonequilibrium systems. Actively driven membranes have been studied for more than two decades, taking advantage of rapid progress in membrane physics and in the experimental development of reconstituted active membranes. The physical description of activity within living biological membranes remains, however, a key challenge that animates a dynamic research community, bringing together physicists and biologists. Here, we first review the past two decades of experimental and theoretical advances that enabled the characterization of mechanical properties and nonequilibrium fluctuations in active membranes. We distinguish active processes originating from membrane proteins or from external interactions, such as cytoskeletal forces. Then, we focus on the emblematic case of red blood cell flickering, the active origin of which has been debated for decades until recently.

Using active and passive microrheology to directly compare the membrane response and fluctuations on single erythrocytes, we report here a violation of the fluctuation–dissipation relation, which is a direct demonstration of the non-equilibrium nature of flickering. With an analytical model of the composite erythrocyte membrane and realistic stochastic simulations, we show that several molecular mechanisms may explain the active fluctuations, and we predict their kinetics. We demonstrate that tangential metabolic activity in the network formed by spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein, can generate curvature-mediated active membrane motions. We also show that other active membrane processes represented by direct normal force dipoles may explain the observed membrane activity.

The mechanisms responsible for reorganizing the plasma membrane at the cell equator and its coupling to the contractile ring in cytokinesis are poorly understood. We report here that Syndapin, a protein containing an F-BAR domain required for membrane curvature, contributes to the remodelling of the plasma membrane around the contractile ring for cytokinesis. Syndapin colocalizes with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) at the cleavage furrow, where it directly interacts with a contractile ring component, Anillin. Accordingly, Anillin is mislocalized during cytokinesis in Syndapin mutants. Elevated or diminished expression of Syndapin leads to cytokinesis defects with abnormal cortical dynamics. The minimal segment of Syndapin, which is able to localize to the cleavage furrow and induce cytokinesis defects, is the F-BAR domain and its immediate C-terminal sequences. Phosphorylation of this region prevents this functional interaction, resulting in reduced ability of Syndapin to bind to and deform membranes. Thus, the dephosphorylated form of Syndapin mediates both remodelling of the plasma membrane and its proper coupling to the cytokinetic machinery.},

By using top-down photolithographic methods and bottom-up assembly approaches, biologically inspired dynamic material systems have been created 1) to sense liquid flow with hair-inspired microelectromechanical systems, 2) to autonomously change shape by utilizing plantlike heterogeneous architectures, 3) to homeostatically influence the surrounding environment through self-regulating adaptive surfaces, and 4) to spatially concentrate chemical species by using synthetic microcompartments. The ever-increasing complexity and remarkable functionalities of such synthetic systems offer an encouraging perspective to the rich set of dynamic and adaptive properties that can potentially be implemented in future man-made material systems.},

	abstract = {Vesicles consisting of a bilayer membrane of amphiphilic lipid molecules are remarkably flexible surfaces that show an amazing variety of shapes of different symmetry and topology. Owing to the fluidity of the membrane, shape transitions such as budding can be induced by temperature changes or the action of optical tweezers. Thermally excited shape fluctuations are both strong and slow enough to be visible by video microscopy. Depending on the physical conditions, vesicles adhere to and unbind from each other or a substrate. This article describes the systematic physical theory developed to understand the static and dynamic aspects of membrane and vesicle configurations. The preferred shapes arise from a competition between curvature energy, which derives from the bending elasticity of the membrane, geometrical constraints such as fixed surface area and fixed enclosed volume, and a signature of the bilayer aspect. These shapes of lowest energy are arranged into phase diagrams, which separate regions of different symmetry by continuous or discontinuous transitions. The geometrical constraints affect the fluctuations around these shapes by creating an effective tension. For vesicles of non-spherical topology, the conformal invariance of the curvature energy leads to conformal diffusion, which signifies a one-fold degeneracy of the ground state. Unbinding and adhesion transitions arise from the balance between attractive interactions and entropic repulsion or a cost in bending energy, respectively. Both the dynamics of equilibrium fluctuations and the dynamics of shape transformations are governed not only by viscous damping in the surrounding liquid but also by internal friction if the two monolayers slip over each other. More complex membranes such as that of the red blood cell exhibit a variety of new phenomena because of coupling between internal degrees of freedom and external geometry.},

We solved the structure of the Drosophila amphiphysin BAR domain. It is a crescent-shaped dimer that binds preferentially to highly curved negatively charged membranes. With its N-terminal amphipathic helix and BAR domain (N-BAR), amphiphysin can drive membrane curvature in vitro and in vivo. The structure is similar to that of arfaptin2, which we find also binds and tubulates membranes. From this, we predict that BAR domains are in many protein families, including sorting nexins, centaurins, and oligophrenins. The universal and minimal BAR domain is a dimerization, membrane-binding, and curvature-sensing module.},

Actin polymerization can generate a local outward push on the membrane. Inward pull from the contractile actomyosin cortex can propagate along the membrane via actin filaments. We use coupled evolution of fields to perform linear stability analysis and numerical calculations. As activity overcomes the stabilizing factors such as surface tension and bending rigidity, the spherical membrane shows instability towards pattern formation, localized pulsation, and running pulsation between poles. We present our results in terms of phase diagrams and evolutions of the coupled fields. They have relevance for living cells and can be verified in experiments on artificial cell-like constructs.},

Despite recent efforts, the gold standard remains the light microscopy of a stained blood film. This method can detect low parasitemia and identify different species of Plasmodium. However, it is time consuming, it requires well trained microscopist and good instrumentation to minimize misinterpretation, thus the costs are considerable. Moreover, the equipment cannot be easily transported and installed. In this paper we propose a new technique named “secondary speckle sensing microscopy” (S3M) based upon extraction of correlation based statistics of speckle patterns generated while illuminating red blood cells with a laser and inspecting them under a microscope. Then, using fuzzy logic ruling and principle component analysis, good quality of separation between healthy and infected red blood cells was demonstrated in preliminary experiments. The proposed technique can be used for automated high rate detection of malaria infected red blood cells.},

Here we investigated Rga7p, an Schizosaccharomyces pombe F-BAR protein with a RhoGAP domain. Localization of Rga7p to the cytokinetic cleavage furrow depends on its F-BAR domain, actin filaments, the formins Cdc12p and For3p, and the presence of a contractile ring. Rga7p is not required for the constriction of the contractile ring but does participate in the transport of a β-glucan synthetase (Bgs4p) from the late Golgi compartments to plasma membrane that is adjacent to the contractile ring. Cells without Rga7p moved Bgs4p normally from the poles to the Golgi complex near to the cell center, but Bgs4p then moved slowly from the late Golgi compartments to the cleavage site. The late arrival and lower than normal numbers of Bgs4p result in septal defects late in cytokinesis, and in the lysis of separating cells, similar to that in cells with mutations in the cwg1+ gene (which encodes Bgs4p)., Summary: F-BAR protein Rga7p is required for the timely delivery of a β-glucan synthetase (Bgs4p) to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis of fission yeast.},

A key goal for this approach is to create nanostructures of high complexity, matching that routinely achieved by ‘top-down’ methods. The self-assembly of DNA molecules provides an attractive route towards this goal. Here I describe a simple method for folding long, single-stranded DNA molecules into arbitrary two-dimensional shapes. The design for a desired shape is made by raster-filling the shape with a 7-kilobase single-stranded scaffold and by choosing over 200 short oligonucleotide ‘staple strands’ to hold the scaffold in place. Once synthesized and mixed, the staple and scaffold strands self-assemble in a single step. The resulting DNA structures are roughly 100 nm in diameter and approximate desired shapes such as squares, disks and five-pointed stars with a spatial resolution of 6 nm. Because each oligonucleotide can serve as a 6-nm pixel, the structures can be programmed to bear complex patterns such as words and images on their surfaces. Finally, individual DNA structures can be programmed to form larger assemblies, including extended periodic lattices and a hexamer of triangles (which constitutes a 30-megadalton molecular complex).},

In this report, we generate a DNA nanopore based on the archetypal six-helix-bundle architecture and systematically characterize it via single-channel current recordings to address several fundamental scientiﬁc questions in this emerging ﬁeld. We establish that the DNA pores exhibit two voltage-dependent conductance states. Low transmembrane voltages favor a stable high-conductance level, which corresponds to an unobstructed DNA pore. The expected inner width of the open channel is conﬁrmed by measuring the conductance change as a function of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) size, whereby smaller PEGs are assumed to enter the pore. PEG sizing also clariﬁes that the main ionconducting path runs through the membrane-spanning channel lumen as opposed to any proposed gap between the outer pore wall and the lipid bilayer. At higher voltages, the channel shows a main low-conductance state probably caused by electric-ﬁeld-induced changes of the DNA pore in its conformation or orientation. This voltage-dependent switching between the open and closed states is observed with planar lipid bilayers as well as bilayers mounted on glass nanopipettes. These ﬁndings settle a discrepancy between two previously published conductances. By systematically exploring a large space of parameters and answering key questions, our report supports the development of DNA nanopores for nanobiotechnology.},

Taking advantage of the universal rules for self-assembly of complementary oligonucleotides, DNA has proven to be an extremely versatile biocompatible building material on the nanoscale. The possibility to chemically integrate functional groups into oligonucleotides, most notably with lipophilic anchors, enabled a widespread usage of DNA as a viable alternative to proteins with respect to functional activity on membranes. As described throughout this review, hybrid DNA-lipid nanostructures can mediate events such as vesicle docking and fusion, or selective partitioning of molecules into phase-separated membranes. Moreover, the major benefit of DNA structural constructs, such as DNA tiles and DNA origami, is the reproducibility and simplicity of their design. DNA nanotechnology can produce functional structures with subnanometer precision and allow for a tight control over their biochemical functionality, e.g., interaction partners. DNA-based membrane nanopores and origami structures able to assemble into two-dimensional networks on top of lipid bilayers are recent examples of the manifold of complex devices that can be achieved. In this review, we will shortly present some of the potentially most relevant avenues and accomplishments of membrane-anchored DNA nanostructures for investigating, engineering, and mimicking lipid membrane-related biophysical processes.},

Aquaporins were dispersed in gum arabic and embedded in amphiphilic polyvinyl alcohol with alkyl side chains (PVA-alkyl). PVA-alkyl embedded with treated aquaporins was then attached to flat sheet PBI membranes using carbodiimide chemistry. PVA-alkyl acted as support for aquaporins to prevent their chemical alteration and also gave the membranes mechanical strength. It was found that membranes modified with PVA-alkyl-AqpZ displayed lower flux declines and higher flux recoveries as compared to unmodified PBI membranes.

While it has been argued that continuum models cannot reproduce the distortions observed in fully-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest that this failure can be overcome by using chemically accurate representations of the protein. We outline our recent advances along these lines with our hybrid continuum-atomistic model, and we show the model is in excellent agreement with fully-atomistic simulations of the nhTMEM16 lipid scramblase. We believe that the speed and accuracy of continuum-atomistic methodologies will make it possible to simulate large scale, slow biological processes, such as membrane morphological changes, that are currently beyond the scope of other computational approaches.

          , 
            Membrane tubulation induced by banana-shaped protein rods is investigated by using coarse-grained meshless membrane simulations. It is found that tubulation is promoted by laterally isotropic membrane inclusions that generate the same sign of spontaneous curvature as the adsorbed protein rods. The inclusions are concentrated in the tubules and reduce the bending energy of the tip of the tubules. On the other hand, inclusions with an opposite curvature suppress tubulation by percolated-network formation at a high protein-rod density while they induce the formation of a spherical membrane bud at a low rod density. When equal amounts of the two types of inclusions (with positive and negative curvatures) are added, their effects cancel each other for the first short period but later the tubulation is slowly accelerated. Positive surface tension suppresses tubulation. Our results suggest that the cooperation of scaffolding of BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domains and isotropic membrane inclusions is important for tubulation.},

A formula for the entropy loss of suppressing one or more mean-curvature modes is developed and applied. For the pair of disks we recover the result of Goulian et al. and Golestanian et al. in a direct manner, avoiding any mappings by Hubbard-Stratonovitch transformations.

They play a role in many cellular processes, but it is unclear how cells control them. Cellular regulation often relies on post-translational modifications of proteins. For biomolecular condensates, such chemical modifications could alter the molecular interaction of key condensate components. Here, we test this idea using a theoretical model based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In particular, we describe the chemical reactions using transition-state theory, which accounts for the non-ideality of phase separation. We identify that fast control, as in cell signalling, is only possible when external energy input drives the reaction out of equilibrium. If this reaction differs inside and outside the droplet, it is even possible to control droplet sizes. Such an imbalance in the reaction could be created by enzymes localizing to the droplet. Since this situation is typical inside cells, we speculate that our proposed mechanism is used to stabilize multiple droplets with independently controlled size and count. Our model provides a novel and thermodynamically consistent framework for describing droplets subject to non-equilibrium chemical reactions.},

	abstract = {Fluid lipid membranes can mediate forces between particles bound to them: A local deformation of the surface geometry created by some object spreads to distant regions, where other objects can respond to it. The physical characteristics of these geometric interactions, and how they are affected by thermal fluctuations, are well described by the simple continuum curvature-elastic Hamiltonian proposed 40years ago by Wolfgang Helfrich. Unfortunately, while the underlying principles are conceptually straightforward, the corresponding calculations are not—largely because one must enforce boundary conditions for finite-sized objects. This challenge has inspired several heuristic approaches for expressing the problem in a point particle language. While streamlining the calculations of leading order results and enabling predictions for higher order corrections, the ad hoc nature of the reformulation leaves its domain of validity unclear. In contrast, the framework of Effective Field Theory (EFT) provides a systematic way to construct a completely equivalent point particle description. In this review we present a detailed account for how this is accomplished. In particular, we use a familiar example from electrostatics as an analogy to motivate the key steps needed to construct an EFT, most notably capturing finite size information in point-like “polarizabilities,” and determining their value through a suitable “matching procedure.” The interaction (free) energy then emerges as a systematic cumulant expansion, for which powerful diagrammatic techniques exist, which we also briefly revisit. We then apply this formalism to derive series expansions for interactions between flat and curved particle pairs, multibody interactions, as well as corrections to all these interactions due to thermal fluctuations.},

              , which leads to the formation of a large-scale pattern across the entire cell body; this has been unveiled by studying the distribution of essential proteins involved in lipid metabolism (PlsY and CdsA). The organization is found to require MreD, which determines morphology in rod-shaped cells. The distribution of protein complexes can be explained as a spontaneous pattern formation arising from the competition between the energy cost of bending that they impose on the membrane, their entropy of mixing, and the geometric constraints in the system. Our results provide evidence for the existence of a self-organized and nonpercolating molecular scaffold involving MreD as an organizer for optimal cell function and growth based on the intrinsic self-assembling properties of biological molecules.},

We show that the stability of the filament’s shape is completely characterized by the parameters associated with protein recruitment and establish that in the bistable regime, proteins aggregate on the filament forming regions of high and low curvatures. This pattern formation is then followed by phase-coarsening that resolves on a time-scale dependent on protein diffusion and drift across the filament, which contend to smooth and maintain the pattern respectively. The model is generalized for multiple species of BAR proteins and we show that the stability of the assembled shape is determined by a competition between proteins attaching on opposing sides.},

This shaping is often aided by the aggregation of membrane-bound proteins that both sense the membrane curvature and shape it. Therefore, these protein inclusions interact with each other through the deformation of the membrane that they influence, and a key question is to understand the law that governs their interaction. Whereas the theoretical case of isotropic proteins is well understood, an important feature of many such proteins is their anisotropic interaction with the membrane. Here, we derive an interaction law for rigid circular membrane inclusions which impose an anisotropic contact angle on the surrounding membrane. We include the effects of both membrane bending and tension. Using asymptotic analysis, we identify two distinguished limits corresponding to weak anisotropy/weak tension and strong anisotropy/strong tension, respectively. The resulting laws exhibit a bistability in the equilibrium separation of inclusions. Inclusions with very weak anisotropy equilibrate with large separation, those with very strong anisotropy equilibrate with small separation, while there is a range of anisotropies for which both equilibria are stable. Our results provide a theoretical mechanism for the global aggregation of inclusions seen both in experiments and simulations.},

	abstract = {Maintaining homeostasis is a fundamental characteristic of living systems. In cells, this is contributed to by the assembly of biochemically distinct organelles, many of which are not membrane bound but form by the physical process of liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). By analogy with LLPS in binary solutions, cellular LLPS was hypothesized to contribute to homeostasis by facilitating “concentration buffering,” which renders the local protein concentration within the organelle robust to global variations in the average cellular concentration (e.g., due to expression noise). Interestingly, concentration buffering was experimentally measured in vivo in a simple organelle with a single solute, while it was observed not to be obeyed in one with several solutes. Here, we formulate theoretically and solve analytically a physical model of LLPS in a ternary solution of two solutes (ϕ and ψ) that interact both homotypically (ϕ–ϕ attractions) and heterotypically (ϕ–ψ attractions). Our physical theory predicts how the coexisting concentrations in LLPS are related to expression noise and thus, generalizes the concept of concentration buffering to multicomponent systems. This allows us to reconcile the seemingly contradictory experimental observations. Furthermore, we predict that incremental changes of the homotypic and heterotypic interactions among the molecules that undergo LLPS, such as those that are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the proteins, may increase the efficiency of concentration buffering of a given system. Thus, we hypothesize that evolution may optimize concentration buffering as an efficient mechanism to maintain LLPS homeostasis and suggest experimental approaches to test this in different systems.},

Protein concentrations in a cell fluctuate considerably because of stochasticity in gene expression and variations in the cell's microenvironment. How cells cope with concentration fluctuations when precision is important is unclear. Klosin et al. used a combination of theoretical and experimental work to demonstrate that phase-separated compartments can effectively reduce protein concentration noise in cells (see the Perspective by Riback and Brangwynne). The results suggest that phase separation provides a mechanism to enhance the robustness of biological systems.

Assuming local thermal equilibrium of vacancies (or free volume) within the couple leads to different intrinsic diffusion coefficients for the two polymer species and to net vacancy fluxes. These fluxes should produce movement of inert markers in the couple relative to a point far from the initial interface. That such marker movements and vacancy fluxes actually occur is demonstrated by experiments in which the motion of 20 nm diameter Au islands is monitored by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. The markers which are initially at the interface between thin films of monodisperse polystyrene (one 2 × 107Mw and the other 1.1 × 105Mw) are progressively displaced toward the lower molecular weight side of the couple. As expected the marker displacement is proportional to the square root of time at the diffusion temperature.},

Dry, aligning, dilute, active matter (DADAM), with its many adjectives, refers to a corner of the multidimensional, fast-growing field of active matter studies. This corner, however, has both historical and theoretical importance for the entire field. These lectures notes first describe this particular status of DADAM. We then provide an overview of our current knowledge of DADAM in a synthetic and coherent manner. This constitutes the bulk of these notes. For convenience, we first describe the phenomenology of simple active particle models representing the basic DADAM classes, limiting ourselves to two spatial dimensions, where most work has been performed. Then we discuss the continuous hydrodynamic theories derived from these models using the Boltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau approach. We show in particular that they are largely faithful to the microscopic level, albeit qualitatively. In the conclusion, we come back to the nodal situation of DADAM within active matter studies and provide perspectives on how one can expand DADAM knowledge into various directions, approaching more realistic and more complex situations in a controlled way.},

	abstract = {Maintaining homeostasis is a fundamental characteristic of living systems. In cells, this is contributed to by the assembly of biochemically distinct organelles, many of which are not membrane bound but form by the physical process of liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). By analogy with LLPS in binary solutions, cellular LLPS was hypothesized to contribute to homeostasis by facilitating “concentration buffering,” which renders the local protein concentration within the organelle robust to global variations in the average cellular concentration (e.g., due to expression noise). Interestingly, concentration buffering was experimentally measured in vivo in a simple organelle with a single solute, while it was observed not to be obeyed in one with several solutes. Here, we formulate theoretically and solve analytically a physical model of LLPS in a ternary solution of two solutes (ϕ and ψ) that interact both homotypically (ϕ–ϕ attractions) and heterotypically (ϕ–ψ attractions). Our physical theory predicts how the coexisting concentrations in LLPS are related to expression noise and thus, generalizes the concept of concentration buffering to multicomponent systems. This allows us to reconcile the seemingly contradictory experimental observations. Furthermore, we predict that incremental changes of the homotypic and heterotypic interactions among the molecules that undergo LLPS, such as those that are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the proteins, may increase the efficiency of concentration buffering of a given system. Thus, we hypothesize that evolution may optimize concentration buffering as an efficient mechanism to maintain LLPS homeostasis and suggest experimental approaches to test this in different systems.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Various microorganisms and some mammalian cells are able to swim in viscous fluids by performing nonreciprocal body deformations, such as rotating attached flagella or by distorting their entire body. In order to perform chemotaxis (i.e., to move toward and to stay at high concentrations of nutrients), they adapt their swimming gaits in a nontrivial manner. Here, we propose a computational model, which features autonomous shape adaptation of microswimmers moving in one dimension toward high field concentrations. As an internal decision-making machinery, we use artificial neural networks, which control the motion of the microswimmer. We present two methods to measure chemical gradients, spatial and temporal sensing, as known for swimming mammalian cells and bacteria, respectively. Using the genetic algorithm NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies, surprisingly simple neural networks evolve. These networks control the shape deformations of the microswimmers and allow them to navigate in static and complex time-dependent chemical environments. By introducing noisy signal transmission in the neural network, the well-known biased run-and-tumble motion emerges. Our work demonstrates that the evolution of a simple and interpretable internal decision-making machinery coupled to the environment allows navigation in diverse chemical landscapes. These findings are of relevance for intracellular biochemical sensing mechanisms of single cells or for the simple nervous system of small multicellular organisms such as \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

General studies of networks are essential to a variety of disciplines, including materials science, neuroscience, electrical engineering, and microbiology. To date, most studies are observational or “top-down,” relying on phenomenological models of nodal behavior deduced from data extracted from observations of the entire network. On the other hand, oscillator synchronization provides a popular “bottom-up” experimental paradigm for studies of network behavior. Synchronization occurs when a large number of networked oscillators tend to phase-lock and reach global consensus, despite the presence of internal disorder (such as differences in oscillator frequencies). However, the state of global consensus is not the only dynamical state manifested within networks of coupled oscillators. Recent work has discovered long-lived states that spontaneously break the underlying symmetries of the network, even when its constituent nodes are identical. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie these exotic symmetry-breaking dynamics will be of general benefit to network science and engineering. To enable experimental studies with unprecedented control and resolution, we developed an oscillator network based on nonlinear nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}RATIONALE{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Complex oscillator dynamics emerge in a variety of settings. Previous experimental studies on symmetry breaking in oscillator networks have manifested such complex behavior only by implementing complicated coupling mechanisms designed for that purpose. By contrast, real-world networks are often dominated by simple coupling, so these previous experimental results cannot readily be generalized. Here, exotic states are seen to emerge within NEMS oscillator networks, just beyond the weak coupling limit in simple settings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}RESULTS{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Using an array of coupled nonlinear NEMS oscillators, we observed spontaneous symmetry breaking in a simple and general network setting. These NEMS oscillator nodes were made to be nearly identical, and their fastest dynamical time scales were short enough to generate large datasets, permitting observation and statistical analyses of exotic, slowly emerging network phenomena. In addition, NEMS are very stable, so that transient effects within the network were able to relax within experimental time scales. We examined the network dynamics in detail throughout parameter space and showed experimentally that a simple network of oscillators can reproduce the predictions of theoretical models with explicit complex interactions. We fully explained these phenomena by applying a higher-order phase approximation to the full oscillator model. As strong evidence of the symmetry-breaking argument, we delineated the symmetry subgroups associated with each state.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}CONCLUSION{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Our results show that simple real-world oscillator networks display complex and exotic system states without the need for complex interactions. Our findings can be applied to observational studies of the behavior of natural or engineered oscillator networks. This work clearly elucidates how a 16-dimensional system, comprising eight magnitude-phase oscillators, collapses into synchronized states that evolve within lower-dimensional subspaces. Real-world networks based on our nonlinear NEMS oscillator platform will enable further insight into the mechanisms by which such behavior emerges in more complex topologies at even larger network scales.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While actin polymerization can generate outward push on the membrane, inward pull from the contractile acto-myosin cortex can propagate to the membrane via actin filaments. Using linear stability analysis and numerical calculations we demonstrate the existence of three different dynamical phases depending on the activity. The spherical membrane gets destabilized towards pattern formation, generation of localized pulsation and traveling waves.

	abstract = {Natural killer (NK) cells are immune effector cells that can detect and lyse cancer cells. However, NK cell exhaustion, a phenotype characterized by reduced secretion of cytolytic models upon serial stimulation, limits the NK cell’s ability to lyse cells. In this work, we investigated in silico strategies that counteract the NK cell’s reduced secretion of cytolytic molecules. To accomplish this goal, we constructed a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of the cytolytic molecules granzyme B (GZMB) and perforin-1 (PRF1) and calibrated the model predictions to published experimental data using a Bayesian parameter estimation approach. We applied an information-theoretic approach to perform a global sensitivity analysis, from which we found that the suppression of phosphatase activity maximizes the secretion of GZMB and PRF1. However, simply reducing the phosphatase activity is shown to deplete the cell’s intracellular pools of GZMB and PRF1. Thus, we added a synthetic Notch (synNotch) signaling circuit to our baseline model as a method for controlling the secretion of GZMB and PRF1 by inhibiting phosphatase activity and increasing production of GZMB and PRF1. We found that the optimal synNotch system depends on the frequency of NK cell stimulation. For only a few rounds of stimulation, the model predicts that inhibition of phosphatase activity leads to more secreted GZMB and PRF1; however, for many rounds of stimulation, the model reveals that increasing production of the cytolytic molecules is the optimal strategy. In total, we developed a mathematical framework that provides actionable insight into engineering robust NK cells for clinical applications.},

However, difﬁculties arise when designing and implementing these architectures in a biological context due to uncertainties inherent in the behaviour of biological systems, and physical limitations of the available parts. In this paper we discuss recent developments in the study of biological control systems, which are increasingly necessary for realisation of complex synthetic biological constructs, focusing on methods for their design and implementation. We establish a range of desirable properties that ease implementation of biological constructs, and apply classical control theory to derive a set of constraints to aid the design of systems that achieve adaptation or disturbance rejection. We demonstrate how these constraints can be used in practice, ﬁrst deriving the necessary structure for a linear system that achieves adaptation, and then embedding this in a non-linear model of biological relevance that could be built in the laboratory.},

	abstract = {Neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory explains how the appearance of purposive design in the adaptations of living organisms can have come about without their intentionally being designed. The explanation relies crucially on the possibility of certain
              physical processes
              : mainly,
              gene replication
              and
              natural selection
              . In this paper, I show that for those processes to be possible without the
              design of biological adaptations
              being encoded in the laws of physics, those laws must have certain other properties. The theory of what these properties are is not part of evolution theory proper, yet without it the neo-Darwinian theory does not fully achieve its purpose of explaining the appearance of design. To this end, I apply constructor theory's new mode of explanation to express exactly within physics the appearance of design, no-design laws, and the logic of self-reproduction and natural selection. I conclude that self-reproduction, replication and natural selection are possible under no-design laws, the only non-trivial condition being that they allow
              digital information
              to be physically instantiated. This has an exact characterization in the constructor theory of information. I also show that under no-design laws an accurate replicator
              requires
              the existence of a ‘vehicle’ constituting, together with the replicator, a self-reproducer.},

	abstract = {Materials undergoing both phase separation and chemical reactions (deﬁned here as all processes that change particle type or number) form an important class of non-equilibrium systems. Examples range from suspensions of self-propelled bacteria with birth–death dynamics, to bio-molecular condensates, or ‘membraneless organelles’, within cells. In contrast to their passive counterparts, such systems have conserved and non-conserved dynamics that do not, in general, derive from a shared free energy. This mismatch breaks time-reversal symmetry and leads to new types of dynamical competition that are absent in or near equilibrium. We construct a canonical scalar ﬁeld theory to describe such systems, with conserved and non-conserved dynamics obeying model B and model A, respectively (in the Hohenberg–Halperin classiﬁcation), chosen such that the two free energies involved are incompatible. The resulting minimal model is shown to capture the various phenomenologies reported previously for more complicated models with the same physical ingredients, including microphase separation, limit cycles and droplet splitting. We ﬁnd a low-dimensional subspace of parameters for which time-reversal symmetry is accidentally recovered, and show that here the dynamics of the order parameter ﬁeld (but not its conserved current) is exactly the same as an equilibrium system in which microphase separation is caused by long-range attractive interactions.},

In this work, we propose a continuum model of pattern formation due to nonreciprocal interaction between multiple species of scalar active matter. The classical Cahn-Hilliard model is minimally modified by supplementing the equilibrium Ginzburg-Landau dynamics with particle-number-conserving currents, which cannot be derived from a free energy, reflecting the microscopic departure from action-reaction symmetry. The strength of the asymmetry in the interaction determines whether the steady state exhibits a macroscopic phase separation or a traveling density wave displaying global polar order. The latter structure, which is equivalent to an active self-propelled smectic phase, coarsens via annihilation of defects, whereas the former structure undergoes Ostwald ripening. The emergence of traveling density waves, which is a clear signature of broken time-reversal symmetry in this active system, is a generic feature of any multicomponent mixture with microscopic nonreciprocal interactions.},

In experiments and large-scale simulations, however, more complex steady states are also seen, comprising a dynamic population of dense clusters in a sea of vapor, or dilute bubbles in a liquid. Here, we show that these microphase-separated states should emerge generically in active matter, without any need to invoke system-specific details. We give a coarse-grained description of them and predict transitions between regimes of bulk phase separation and microphase separation. We achieve these results by extending the ϕ4 field theory of passive phase separation to allow for all local currents that break detailed balance at leading order in the gradient expansion. These local active currents, whose form we show to emerge from coarse graining of microscopic models, include a mixture of irrotational and rotational contributions and can be viewed as arising from an effective nonlocal chemical potential. Such contributions influence, and in some parameter ranges reverse, the classical Ostwald process that would normally drive bulk phase separation to completion.},

In a generic class of active matter, the interactions between the active components are represented via an effective density-dependent diffusivity in a mean-field single-particle description. Here, a class of scalar active matter is proposed by incorporating a diffusivity edge into the dynamics: when the local density of the system surpasses a critical threshold, the diffusivity vanishes. The effect of the diffusivity edge is studied under the influence of an external potential, which introduces the ability to control the behavior of the system by changing an effective temperature, which is defined in terms of the single-particle diffusivity and mobility. At a critical effective temperature, a system that is trapped by a harmonic potential is found to undergo a condensation transition, which manifests formal similarities to Bose-Einstein condensation.},

While the physics of few-component liquid mixtures (i.e., binary and ternary ones) is well-understood and routinely taught in undergraduate courses, the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of N-component mixtures with N {\textgreater} 3 have remained relatively unexplored. An example of such a mixture is provided by the intracellular fluid, in which protein-rich droplets phase separate into distinct membraneless organelles. In this work, we investigate equilibrium phase behavior and morphology of N-component liquid mixtures within the Flory–Huggins theory of regular solutions. In order to determine the number of coexisting phases and their compositions, we developed a new algorithm for constructing complete phase diagrams, based on numerical convexification of the discretized free energy landscape. Together with a Cahn–Hilliard approach for kinetics, we employ this method to study mixtures with N = 4 and 5 components. We report on both the coarsening behavior of such systems, as well as the resulting morphologies in three spatial dimensions. We discuss how the number of coexisting phases and their compositions can be extracted with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering algorithms. Finally, we discuss how one can reverse engineer the interaction parameters and volume fractions of components in order to achieve a range of desired packing structures, such as nested “Russian dolls” and encapsulated Janus droplets.},

	abstract = {The problem of low-rank approximation with convex constraints, which appears in data analysis, system identification, model order reduction, low-order controller design, and low-complexity modeling is considered. Given a matrix, the objective is to find a low-rank approximation that meets rank and convex constraints while minimizing the distance to the matrix in the squared Frobenius norm. In many situations, this nonconvex problem is convexified by nuclear-norm regularization. However, we will see that the approximations obtained by this method may be far from optimal. In this paper, we propose an alternative convex relaxation that uses the convex envelope of the squared Frobenius norm and the rank constraint. With this approach, easily verifiable conditions are obtained under which the solutions to the convex relaxation and the original nonconvex problem coincide. A semidefinite programming representation of the convex envelope is derived, which allows us to apply this approach to several known problems. Our example on optimal low-rank Hankel approximation/model reduction illustrates that the proposed convex relaxation performs consistently better than nuclear-norm regularization and may outperform balanced truncation.},

	abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms can cause a group of isogenic bacteria, each subject to identical environmental conditions, to nevertheless exhibit diverse patterns of gene expression. The resulting phenotypic subpopulations will typically have distinct growth rates. This behavior has been observed in several contexts, including sugar metabolism and pili phase variation. Under ﬁxed environmental conditions, the net growth rate of the population is maximized when all cells are of the fastest growing phenotype, so it is unclear what ﬁtness advantage is conferred by population heterogeneity. However, unlike ideal laboratory conditions, natural environments tend to ﬂuctuate, either periodically or randomly. Here we use a stochastic population model to show that, during growth in such ﬂuctuating environments, a dynamically heterogenous bacterial population can sometimes achieve a higher net growth rate than a homogenous one. By using stochastic mechanisms to sample several distinct phenotypes, the bacteria are able to anticipate and take advantage of sudden changes in their environment. However, this heterogeneity is beneﬁcial only if the bacterial response rate is sufﬁciently low. Our results could be useful in the design of artiﬁcial evolution experiments and in the optimization of fermentation processes.},

In some cases, however, and in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, cells choose one or another pathway of differentiation stochastically without apparent regard to environment or history.

	abstract = {Historically, scalability has been a major challenge to the successful application of semidefinite programming in fields such as machine learning, control, and robotics. In this paper, we survey recent approaches for addressing this challenge including (i) approaches for exploiting structure (e.g., sparsity and symmetry) in a problem, (ii) approaches that produce low-rank approximate solutions to semidefinite programs, (iii) more scalable algorithms that rely on augmented Lagrangian techniques and the alternating direction method of multipliers, and (iv) approaches that trade off scalability with conservatism (e.g., by approximating semidefinite programs with linear and second-order cone programs). For each class of approaches we provide a high-level exposition, an entry-point to the corresponding literature, and examples drawn from machine learning, control, or robotics. We also present a list of software packages that implement many of the techniques discussed in the paper. Our hope is that this paper will serve as a gateway to the rich and exciting literature on scalable semidefinite programming for both theorists and practitioners.},

In order that one may treat the joint distribution of the variate values at several instants of time, the Bartlett relation is generalized to provide equations (40) and (41) for the characteristic functional of the process.

The goal is to achieve a closed form of a large, usually even infinite, set of coupled differential (or difference) equations. Each equation describes the evolution of one "moment", a suitable coarse-grained quantity computable from the full state space. If the system is too large for analytical and/or numerical methods, then one aims to reduce it by finding a moment closure relation expressing "higher-order moments" in terms of "lower-order moments". In this brief review, we focus on highlighting how moment closure methods occur in different contexts. We also conjecture via a geometric explanation why it has been difficult to rigorously justify many moment closure approximations although they work very well in practice.},

Such networks are often described using the framework of the Chemical Master Equation (CME). For physically-realistic models, the CME is widely considered to be analytically intractable. A variety of Monte Carlo algorithms have therefore been developed to explore the dynamics of such networks empirically. Amongst them is the multi-level method, which uses estimates from multiple ensembles of sample paths of different accuracies to estimate a summary statistic of interest. In this work, we develop the multi-level method in two directions: (1) to increase the robustness, reliability and performance of the multi-level method, we implement an improved variance reduction method for generating the sample paths of each ensemble; and (2) to improve computational performance, we demonstrate the successful use of a different mechanism for choosing which ensembles should be included in the multi-level algorithm.},

	abstract = {We propose a topological learning algorithm for the estimation of the conditional dependency structure of large sets of random variables from sparse and noisy data. The algorithm, named Maximally Filtered Clique Forest (MFCF), produces a clique forest and an associated Markov Random Field (MRF) by generalising Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, the MFCF presents three elements of novelty with respect to existing structure learning approaches. The first is the repeated application of a local topological move, the clique expansion, that preserves the decomposability of the underlying graph. Through this move the decomposability and calculation of scores is performed incrementally at the variable (rather than edge) level, and this provides better computational performance and an intuitive application of multivariate statistical tests. The second is the capability to accommodate a variety of score functions and, while this paper is focused on multivariate normal distributions, it can be directly generalised to different types of statistics. Finally, the third is the variable range of allowed clique sizes which is an adjustable topological constraint that acts as a topological penalizer providing a way to tackle sparsity at \$l\_0\$ semi-norm level; this allows a clean decoupling of structure learning and parameter estimation. The MFCF produces a representation of the clique forest, together with a perfect ordering of the cliques and a perfect elimination ordering for the vertices. As an example we propose an application to covariance selection models and we show that the MCFC outperforms the Graphical Lasso for a number of classes of matrices.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A critical disadvantage of primal-dual interior-point methods compared to dual interior-point methods for large scale semidefinite programs (SDPs) has been that the primal positive semidefinite matrix variable becomes fully dense in general even when all data matrices are sparse. Based on some fundamental results about positive semidefinite matrix completion, this article proposes a general method of exploiting the aggregate sparsity pattern over all data matrices to overcome this disadvantage. Our method is used in two ways. One is a conversion of a sparse SDP having a large scale positive semidefinite matrix variable into an SDP having multiple but smaller positive semidefinite matrix variables to which we can effectively apply any interior-point method for SDPs employing a standard block-diagonal matrix data structure. The other way is an incorporation of our method into primal-dual interior-point methods which we can apply directly to a given SDP. In Part II of this article, we will investigate an implementation of such a primal-dual interior-point method based on positive definite matrix completion, and report some numerical results.

While existing relaxations globally solve many OPF problems, there are practical problems for which existing relaxations fail to yield physically meaningful solutions. This paper applies moment relaxations to solve many of these OPF problems. The moment relaxations are developed from the Lasserre hierarchy for solving generalized moment problems. Increasing the relaxation order in this hierarchy results in “tighter” relaxations at the computational cost of larger semidefinite programs. Low-order moment relaxations are capable of globally solving many small OPF problems for which existing relaxations fail. By exploiting sparsity and only applying the higher-order relaxation to specific buses, global solutions to larger problems are computationally tractable through the use of an iterative algorithm informed by a heuristic for choosing where to apply the higher-order constraints. With standard semidefinite programming solvers, the algorithm globally solves many test systems with up to 300 buses for which the existing semidefinite relaxation fails to yield globally optimal solutions.},

Cells contain a vast array of enzymes that collectively perform essential tasks by harnessing energy from chemical reactions. Despite the complexity, intra- and intercellular motility at low Reynolds numbers remain the epicenter of life. In the past decade, detailed investigations on enzymes that are freely dispersed in solution have revealed concentration-dependent enhanced diffusion and chemotactic behavior during catalysis. Theoretical calculations and simulations have determined the magnitude of the impulsive force per turnover; however, an unequivocal consensus regarding the mechanism of enhanced diffusion has not been reached. Furthermore, this mechanical force can be transferred from the active enzymes to inert particles or surrounding fluid, thereby providing a platform for the design of biomimetic systems. Understanding the factors governing enzyme motion would help us to understand organization principles for dissipative self-assembly and the fabrication of molecular machines. The purpose of this article is to review the different classes of enzyme motility and discuss the possible mechanisms as gleaned from experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Finally, we focus on the relevance of enzyme motion in biology and its role in future applications.},

	abstract = {We employ chordal decomposition to reformulate a large and sparse semidefinite program (SDP), either in primal or dual standard form, into an equivalent SDP with smaller positive semidefinite (PSD) constraints. In contrast to previous approaches, the decomposed SDP is suitable for the application of first-order operator-splitting methods, enabling the development of efficient and scalable algorithms. In particular, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve decomposed primal- and dual-standard-form SDPs. Each iteration of such ADMM algorithms requires a projection onto an affine subspace, and a set of projections onto small PSD cones that can be computed in parallel. We also formulate the homogeneous self-dual embedding (HSDE) of a primal-dual pair of decomposed SDPs, and extend a recent ADMM-based algorithm to exploit the structure of our HSDE. The resulting HSDE algorithm has the same leading-order computational cost as those for the primal or dual problems only, with the advantage of being able to identify infeasible problems and produce an infeasibility certificate. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source MATLAB solver CDCS. Numerical experiments on a range of large-scale SDPs demonstrate the computational advantages of the proposed methods compared to common state-of-the-art solvers.},

The statistical moments of these systems can be described by a system of linear ordinary differential equations.

Here, we develop a methodology for bounding statistical moments by using the higher order moments as inputs to an auxiliary convex optimal control problem with semidefinite constraints. For steady-state problems, the auxiliary optimal control problem reduces to a static semidefinite program. The method applies to both controlled and uncontrolled stochastic processes. For stochastic optimal control problems, the method gives bounds on achievable performance and can be used to compute approximately optimal solutions. For uncontrolled problems, both upper and lower bounds on desired moments can be computed. While the accuracy of most moment approximations cannot be quantitatively characterized, our method guarantees that the moment of interest is between the computed bounds.},

	abstract = {This article introduces the finite state projection (FSP) method for use in the stochastic analysis of chemically reacting systems. One can describe the chemical populations of such systems with probability density vectors that evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME). Unlike Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) or ττ{\textless}math baseline="-0.5" display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}τ{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} leaping, the FSP directly solves or approximates the solution of the CME. If the CME describes a system that has a finite number of distinct population vectors, the FSP method provides an exact analytical solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of population variations is possible, the state space can be truncated, and the FSP method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the truncated space approximation matches the true solution. The proposed FSP algorithm systematically increases the projection space in order to meet prespecified tolerance in the total probability density error. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate FSP exists, the FSP algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The FSP is utilized to solve two examples taken from the field of systems biology, and comparisons are made between the FSP, the SSA, and ττ{\textless}math baseline="-0.5" display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00002.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}τ{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} leaping algorithms.

	abstract = {[It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.]},

Yet despite widespread “microscopic” epistasis between the mutations involved, microbial evolution experiments show consistent patterns of ﬁtness increase between replicate lines. Recent work shows that this consistency is driven in part by global patterns of diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis, which make mutations systematically less beneﬁcial (or more deleterious) on ﬁtter genetic backgrounds. However, the mechanistic basis of this “global” epistasis remains unknown. Here we show that diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis emerge generically as a consequence of pervasive microscopic epistasis. Our model predicts a speciﬁc quantitative relationship between the magnitude of global epistasis and the stochastic eﬀects of microscopic epistasis, which we conﬁrm by re-analyzing existing data. We further show that the distribution of ﬁtness eﬀects takes on a universal form when epistasis is widespread, and introduce a novel ﬁtness landscape model to show how phenotypic evolution can be repeatable despite sequence-level stochasticity.},

Understanding how cells can achieve homeostasis, despite the intrinsic noise or randomness in their dynamics, is fundamentally important for both systems and synthetic biology. In this context, a significant development is the proposed antithetic integral feedback (AIF) motif, which is found in natural systems, and is known to ensure robust perfect adaptation for the mean dynamics of a given molecular species involved in a complex stochastic biomolecular reaction network. From the standpoint of applications, one drawback of this motif is that it often leads to an increased cell-to-cell heterogeneity or variance when compared to a constitutive (i.e. open-loop) control strategy. Our goal in this paper is to show that this performance deterioration can be countered by combining the AIF motif and a negative feedback strategy. Using a tailored moment closure method, we derive approximate expressions for the stationary variance for the controlled network that demonstrate that increasing the strength of the negative feedback can indeed decrease the variance, sometimes even below its constitutive level. Numerical results verify the accuracy of these results and we illustrate them by considering three biomolecular networks with two types of negative feedback strategies. Our computational analysis indicates that there is a trade-off between the speed of the settling-time of the mean trajectories and the stationary variance of the controlled species; i.e. smaller variance is associated with larger settling-time.},

Entrance into competence can be attributed to the excitability of the dynamics governing the genetic circuit that regulates this cellular behavior. Like many biological behaviors, entrance into competence is a stochastic event. In this case cellular noise is responsible for driving the cell from a vegetative state into competence and back. In this work we present a novel numerical method for the analysis of stochastic biochemical events and use it to study the excitable dynamics responsible for competence in Bacillus subtilis. Starting with a Finite State Projection (FSP) solution of the chemical master equation (CME), we develop efficient numerical tools for accurately computing competence probability. Additionally, we propose a new approach for the sensitivity analysis of stochastic events and utilize it to elucidate the robustness properties of the competence regulatory genetic circuit. We also propose and implement a numerical method to calculate the expected time it takes a cell to return from competence.

	abstract = {Synthetic biology is an interdisciplinary field aiming to design biochemical systems with desired behaviors. To this end, molecular controllers have been developed which, when embedded into a pre-existing ambient biochemical network, control the dynamics of the underlying target molecular species. When integrated into smaller compartments, such as biological cells in vivo, or vesicles in vitro, controllers have to be calibrated to factor in the intrinsic noise. In this context, molecular controllers put forward in the literature have focused on manipulating the mean (first moment), and reducing the variance (second moment), of the target species. However, many critical biochemical processes are realized via higher-order moments, particularly the number and configuration of the modes (maxima) of the probability distributions. To bridge the gap, a controller called stochastic morpher is put forward in this paper, inspired by gene-regulatory networks, which, under suitable time-scale separations, morphs the probability distribution of the target species into a desired predefined form. The morphing can be performed at the lower-resolution, allowing one to achieve desired multi-modality/multi-stability, and at the higher-resolution, allowing one to achieve arbitrary probability distributions. Properties of the controller, such as robust perfect adaptation and convergence, are rigorously established, and demonstrated on various examples. Also proposed is a blueprint for an experimental implementation of stochastic morpher.},

	abstract = {Homeostasis is a recurring theme in biology that ensures that regulated variables robustly—and in some systems, completely—adapt to environmental perturbations. This robust perfect adaptation feature is achieved in natural circuits by using integral control, a negative feedback strategy that performs mathematical integration to achieve structurally robust regulation1,2. Despite its benefits, the synthetic realization of integral feedback in living cells has remained elusive owing to the complexity of the required biological computations. Here we prove mathematically that there is a single fundamental biomolecular controller topology3 that realizes integral feedback and achieves robust perfect adaptation in arbitrary intracellular networks with noisy dynamics. This adaptation property is guaranteed both for the population-average and for the time-average of single cells. On the basis of this concept, we genetically engineer a synthetic integral feedback controller in living cells4 and demonstrate its tunability and adaptation properties. A growth-rate control application in Escherichia coli shows the intrinsic capacity of our integral controller to deliver robustness and highlights its potential use as a versatile controller for regulation of biological variables in uncertain networks. Our results provide conceptual and practical tools in the area of cybergenetics3,5, for engineering synthetic controllers that steer the dynamics of living systems3–9.},

The deterministic analogue to stochastic models, a set of probability moment equations equivalent to the Chemical Master Equation (CME), offers the possibility of a priori analysis of systems without the need for computationally costly Monte Carlo simulations. Despite the drawbacks of the method, in particular non-linearity in even the simplest of cases, the use of moment equations combined with moment-closure techniques has been used effectively in many fields. The techniques currently available to generate moment equations rely upon analytical expressions that are not efficient upon scaling. Additionally, the resulting moment-dependent matrix is lower diagonal and demands massive memory allocation in extreme cases. Here it is demonstrated that by utilizing factorial moments and the probability generating function (the Z-transform of the probability distribution) a recursive algorithm is produced. The resulting method is scalable and particularly efficient when high-order moments are required. The matrix produced is banded and often demands substantially less memory resources.},

We show that the stochastic moments lie in a convex semi-algebraic set specified by linear matrix inequalities. Thus, the upper and the lower bounds of some moments can be computed by a semidefinite program.

The second SSA is an off-lattice model based on the simulation of Brownian motion of individual molecules and their reactive collisions. In both cases, it is shown that the commonly used implementation of bimolecular reactions (i.e. the reactions of the form A + B → C or A + A → C) might lead to incorrect results. Improvements of both SSAs are suggested which overcome the difﬁculties highlighted. In particular, a formula is presented for the smallest possible compartment size (lattice spacing) which can be correctly implemented in the ﬁrst model. This implementation uses a new formula for the rate of bimolecular reactions per compartment (lattice site).},

	abstract = {In the stochastic description of biochemical reaction systems, the time evolution of statistical moments for species population counts is described by a linear dynamical system. However, except for some ideal cases (such as zero- and first-order reaction kinetics), the moment dynamics is underdetermined as lower-order moments depend upon higher-order moments. Here, we propose a novel method to find exact lower and upper bounds on stationary moments for a given arbitrary system of biochemical reactions. The method exploits the fact that statistical moments of any positive-valued random variable must satisfy some constraints that are compactly represented through the positive semidefiniteness of moment matrices. Our analysis shows that solving moment equations at steady state in conjunction with constraints on moment matrices provides exact lower and upper bounds on the moments. These results are illustrated by three different examples—the commonly used logistic growth model, stochastic gene expression with auto-regulation and an activator–repressor gene network motif. Interestingly, in all cases the accuracy of the bounds is shown to improve as moment equations are expanded to include higher-order moments. Our results provide avenues for development of approximation methods that provide explicit bounds on moments for nonlinear stochastic systems that are otherwise analytically intractable.},

          , 
            Biological cells are capable of undergoing extensive shape transformations thanks to the existence of membrane area reservoirs from which they can pull out membrane when required. A particularly relevant example of such membrane remodelling is given by endocytic and phagocytic processes, during which the cell membrane engulfs nano- and micrometer sized particles. Recently, it was shown that cell-like membrane reservoirs can be mimicked in giant vesicles with nanotubes stabilized by strong bilayer asymmetry, as quantified by the membrane's spontaneous curvature. Here, we theoretically investigate particle engulfment by such strongly-asymmetric membranes. We find that, depending on the sign of the spontaneous curvature, the engulfment transition may be continuous or discontinuous. Moreover, we find that, in the case of particle engulfment, the presence of asymmetry-stabilized reservoirs is not well captured by the constant-tension model typically used to describe cell-membrane deformations. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the nature of cellular membrane reservoirs, in order to accurately describe membrane remodelling processes.},

Evidence suggests that droplets can be degraded by autophagy3,4, a highly conserved degradation system in which membrane sheets bend to isolate portions of the cytoplasm within double-membrane autophagosomes5–7. Here we examine how autophagosomes sequester droplets that contain the protein p62 (also known as SQSTM1) in living cells, and demonstrate that double-membrane, autophagosome-like vesicles form at the surface of protein-free droplets in vitro through partial wetting. A minimal physical model shows that droplet surface tension supports the formation of membrane sheets. The model also predicts that bending sheets either divide droplets for piecemeal sequestration or sequester entire droplets. We find that autophagosomal sequestration is robust to variations in the droplet-sheet adhesion strength. However, the two sides of partially wetted sheets are exposed to different environments, which can determine the bending direction of autophagosomal sheets. Our discovery of this interplay between the material properties of droplets and membrane sheets enables us to elucidate the mechanisms that underpin droplet autophagy, or ‘fluidophagy’. Furthermore, we uncover a switching mechanism that allows droplets to act as liquid assembly platforms for cytosol-degrading autophagosomes8 or as specific autophagy substrates9–11. We propose that droplet-mediated autophagy represents a previously undescribed class of processes that are driven by elastocapillarity, highlighting the importance of wetting in cytosolic organization.},

The stationary distributions of CMEs are seldom solvable analytically, and numerical methods typically produce estimates with uncontrolled errors. Here, we introduce mathematical programming approaches that yield approximations of these distributions with computable error bounds which enable the verification of their accuracy. First, we use semidefinite programming to compute increasingly tighter upper and lower bounds on the moments of the stationary distributions for networks with rational propensities. Second, we use these moment bounds to formulate linear programs that yield convergent upper and lower bounds on the stationary distributions themselves, their marginals, and stationary averages. The bounds obtained also provide a computational test for the uniqueness of the distribution. In the unique case, the bounds form an approximation of the stationary distribution with a computable bound on its error. In the nonunique case, our approach yields converging approximations of the ergodic distributions. We illustrate our methodology through several biochemical examples taken from the literature: Schlögl’s model for a chemical bifurcation, a two-dimensional toggle switch, a model for bursty gene expression, and a dimerization model with multiple stationary distributions.},

In this review, we ﬁrst give a comprehensive theoretical account of the stationary distributions and their relation to the long-term behaviour of CTMCs that is readily accessible to non-experts and free of irreducibility assumptions made in standard texts. We then review truncation-based approximation schemes for CTMCs with inﬁnite state spaces paying particular attention to the schemes’ convergence and the errors they introduce, and we illustrate their performance with an example of a stochastic reaction network of relevance in biology and chemistry.

	abstract = {We introduce an algorithm based on semideﬁnite programming that yields increasing (resp., decreasing) sequences of lower (resp., upper) bounds on polynomial stationary averages of diﬀusions with polynomial drift vector and diﬀusion coeﬃcients. The bounds are obtained by optimizing an objective, determined by the stationary average of interest, over the set of real vectors deﬁned by certain linear equalities and semideﬁnite inequalities which are satisﬁed by the moments of any stationary measure of the diﬀusion. We exemplify the use of the approach through several applications: a Bayesian inference problem; the computation of Lyapunov exponents of linear ordinary diﬀerential equations perturbed by multiplicative white noise; and a reliability problem from structural mechanics. Additionally, we prove that the bounds converge to the inﬁmum and supremum of the set of stationary averages for certain SDEs associated with the computation of the Lyapunov exponents, and we provide numerical evidence of convergence in more general settings.},

              Engineered RNA elements are programmable tools capable of detecting small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. Predicting the behavior of these synthetic biology components remains a challenge, a situation that could be addressed through enhanced pattern recognition from deep learning. Here, we investigate Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to predict toehold switch function as a canonical riboswitch model in synthetic biology. To facilitate DNN training, we synthesize and characterize in vivo a dataset of 91,534 toehold switches spanning 23 viral genomes and 906 human transcription factors. DNNs trained on nucleotide sequences outperform (R

	abstract = {Many experiments in recent years have reported that, when exposed to their corresponding substrate, catalytic enzymes undergo enhanced diﬀusion as well as chemotaxis (biased motion in the direction of a substrate gradient). Among other possible mechanisms, in a number of recent works we have explored several passive mechanisms for enhanced diﬀusion and chemotaxis, in the sense that they require only binding and unbinding of the enzyme to the substrate rather than the catalytic reaction itself. These mechanisms rely on conformational changes of the enzyme due to binding, as well as on phoresis due to non-contact interactions between enzyme and substrate. Here, after reviewing and generalizing our previous ﬁndings, we extend them in two diﬀerent ways. In the case of enhanced diﬀusion, we show that an exact result for the long-time diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the enzyme can be obtained using generalized Taylor dispersion theory, which results in much simpler and transparent analytical expressions for the diﬀusion enhancement. In the case of chemotaxis, we show that the competition between phoresis and binding-induced changes in diﬀusion results in non-trivial steady state distributions for the enzyme, which can either accumulate in or be depleted from regions with a speciﬁc substrate concentration.},

	abstract = {In order to capture important subcellular dynamics, researchers in computational biology have begun to turn to mesoscopic models in which molecular interactions at the gene level behave as discrete stochastic events. While the trajectories of such models cannot be described with deterministic expressions, the probability distributions of these trajectories can be described by the set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME). Until recently, it has been believed that the CME could only be solved analytically in the most trivial of problems, and the CME has been analyzed almost exclusively with kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithms. However, concepts from linear systems theory have enabled the ﬁnite state projection (FSP) approach and have signiﬁcantly enhanced our ability to solve the CME without resorting to KMC simulations. In this paper, we review the FSP approach and introduce a variety of systems-theory-based modiﬁcations and enhancements to the FSP algorithm. Notions such as observability, controllability, and minimal realizations enable large reductions and increase efﬁciency with little to no loss in accuracy. Model reduction techniques based upon linear perturbation theory allow for the systematic projection of multiple time-scale dynamics onto a slowly varying manifold of much smaller dimension. We also present a powerful new reduction approach, in which we perform computations on a small subset of conﬁguration grid points and then interpolate to ﬁnd the distribution on the full set. The power of the FSP and its various reduction approaches is illustrated on few important models of genetic regulatory networks.},

	abstract = {Consider the standard stochastic reaction network model where the dynamics is given by a continuous-time Markov chain over a discrete lattice. For such models, estimation of parameter sensitivities is an important problem, but the existing computational approaches to solve this problem usually require time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations of the reaction dynamics. Therefore, these simulation-based approaches can only be expected to work over ﬁnite time-intervals, while it is often of interest in applications to examine the sensitivity values at the steady-state after the Markov chain has relaxed to its stationary distribution. The aim of this paper is to present a computational method for the estimation of steady-state parameter sensitivities, which instead of using simulations relies on the recently developed stationary ﬁnite state projection algorithm [Gupta et al., J. Chem. Phys. 147, 154101 (2017)] that provides an accurate estimate of the stationary distribution at a ﬁxed set of parameters. We show that sensitivity values at these parameters can be estimated from the solution of a Poisson equation associated with the inﬁnitesimal generator of the Markov chain. We develop an approach to numerically solve the Poisson equation, and this yields an efﬁcient estimator for steady-state parameter sensitivities. We illustrate this method using several examples.},

These results provide direct proof that tau is a physiological substrate for LRRK2. Furthermore, we revealed that LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of tau reduces its tubulin-binding ability.

	abstract = {In Parkinson's disease (PD) there is a selective loss of certain midbrain  dopaminergic (DA) neurons. The most vulnerable neurons reside in the substantia  nigra zona compacta (SNC), whereas the DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area  (VTA) and interfascicular (IF) nucleus are less vulnerable to degeneration. Many  sporadic PD patients have a defect in mitochondria respiration, and some of the  genes that cause PD are mitochondrial-related (e.g., PINK1, Parkin, DJ1). The  present study sought to determine whether mitochondria mass is different in SNC  neurons compared to other midbrain DA neurons and to non-DA neurons in the mouse. At  the electron microscopic level, mitochondria in the SN DA neurons occupy 40\% less of  the soma and dendritic area than in the SN non-DA neurons. The area occupied by  mitochondria in the SN DA neurons is also lower than in the VTA neurons, although  not different from the IF neurons. The red nucleus somata have the largest  percentage of the somata occupied by mitochondria (12\%). Mitochondria size is  related to somata size; the largest mitochondria are found in the red nucleus  neurons and the smallest mitochondria are found in the IF neurons. At the light  microscopic level, SNC, VTA and IF DA neurons have {\textless}50\% of the cytoplasm  immunostained with the mitochondrial antibody 1D6, whereas non-DA neurons in the  same midbrain regions contain mitochondria areas up to {\textgreater}65\% of the cytoplasm area.  These data indicate that mitochondria size and mass are not the same for all  neurons, and the SNC DA neurons have relatively low mitochondria mass. The low  mitochondria mass in SNC DA neurons may contribute to the selective vulnerability of  these neurons in certain rodent models of PD.},

	abstract = {PD (Parkinson's disease) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. Mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) gene are linked to the most common inherited and sporadic PD. Overexpression of LRRK2 and its mutants could induce mitochondrial-dependent neuronal apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We have identified several novel LRRK2 interacting proteins and showed that LRRK2 can interact with three components of the PTPC (permeability transition pore complex) including ANT (adenine nucleotide translocator), VDAC (voltage-dependent anion channel) and uMtCK [ubiquitous MtCK (mitochondrial creatine kinase)]. Those components have been reported to be involved in the permeability of mitochondrial membrane. We provide evidence that LRRK2 is likely to interact with uMtCK directly and expression of LRRK2 and its mutant form can suppress the processing of the immature form of uMtCK. LRRK2 expression keeps the uMtCK preprotein on the outer mitochondrial membrane instead of entering the mitochondria. In addition, the expression of both wild-type and mutant forms of LRRK2 promotes the interaction between ANT and VDAC, which plays a role in permeabilization transition pore opening. Finally, LRRK2-induced cell death can be suppressed by uMtCK. Our findings imply that LRRK2 can interact directly with uMtCK to block its entry into mitochondria and its subsequent processing, resulting in inhibition of mitochondrial energy channelling. Meanwhile, the decrease of uMtCK in mitochondria results in elevated interaction between ANT and VDAC and leads to neuronal apoptosis. Thus, our study provides the rational for clinical trials using creatine to treat PD and supports the notion of exploiting LRRK2 as a drug target for PD.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneous nature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms and variability in their progression complicates patient treatment and interpretation of clinical trials. Consequently, there is much interest in developing models that can predict PD progression. In this study we have used serum samples from a clinically well characterized longitudinally followed Michael J Fox Foundation cohort of PD patients with and without the common leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S mutation. We have measured 27 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in serum at baseline and after 1 year to investigate cytokine stability. We then used the baseline measurements in conjunction with machine learning models to predict longitudinal clinical outcomes after 2 years follow up. Using the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) as a measure of performance, the best prediction models were for the motor symptom severity scales, with NRMSE of 0.1123 for the Hoehn and Yahr scale and 0.1193 for the unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale part three (UPDRS III). For each model, the top variables contributing to prediction were identified, with the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein one alpha (MIP1α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein one (MCP1) making the biggest peripheral contribution to prediction of Hoehn and Yahr and UPDRS III, respectively. These results provide information on the longitudinal assessment of peripheral inflammatory cytokines in PD and give evidence that peripheral cytokines may have utility for aiding prediction of PD progression using machine learning models.},

The underlying mechanisms of neurodegeneration in PD are still  unknown, and there are no disease-modifying treatments to slow the neurodegenerative  processes. There is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that are able to monitor  disease progression and assess the development and efficacy of novel  disease-modifying drugs. Over the past years, neuroimaging techniques such as  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography  (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET) have provided important advances in  our understanding of PD. MRI provides information about structural and functional  organization of the brain, while SPECT and PET can detect molecular changes in the  brain. Here, we review the current neuroimaging literature in sporadic and genetic  PD, which have contributed to our understanding of the physiopathological mechanisms  of the disease.},

Increased  risk of Parkinson's disease has been associated with exposure to pesticides,  consumption of dairy products, history of melanoma, and traumatic brain injury,  whereas a reduced risk has been reported in association with smoking, caffeine  consumption, higher serum urate concentrations, physical activity, and use of  ibuprofen and other common medications. Randomised trials are investigating the  possibility that some of the negative risk factors might be neuroprotective and thus  beneficial in individuals with early Parkinson's disease, particularly with respect  to smoking (nicotine), caffeine, and urate. In the future, it might be possible to  identify Parkinson's disease in its prodromal phase and to promote neuroprotective  interventions before the onset of motor symptoms.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the causative gene linked to PARK8 parkinsonism was identified as LRRK2, LRRK2 gene mutations have been found to occur in about 4\% of patients with hereditary Parkinson disease (PD); this percentage is even higher in certain populations. Moreover, no clear clinical differences between PARK8-linked parkinsonism and sporadic PD have been identified. Neuropathologic findings have been diverse in PARK8 parkinsonism, but few of the clinicopathologic examinations have been performed in the same family tree. We aimed to describe PET and neuropathologic findings in members of the same family tree with PARK8 parkinsonism. METHODS: We conducted PET of 2 subjects and neuropathologically examined 8 subjects in the same family from the Sagamihara district, the original source of PARK8-linked parkinsonism (I2020T mutation). RESULTS: The results of the PET scans were virtually identical to those seen in sporadic PD. The neuropathologic study results showed pure nigral degeneration with no Lewy bodies in 6 cases. One case, however, showed the presence of Lewy bodies and was similar neuropathologically to conventional PD with Lewy bodies. Another case had multiple system atrophy pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of PARK8-linked parkinsonism affecting several members of the same pedigree shows that the same gene mutation can induce diverse neuropathologies, even if the clinical picture and PET findings are virtually identical.},

Screening of the most frequent LRRK2 mutations (G2019S, R1441C, R1441G) in the  extended sample of PD patients (100 familial cases, 14 relatives and 230 sporadic  cases) revealed two novel families with G2019S-PD in the addition to  LRRK2-associated PD cases identified earlier.

	abstract = {Mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) are the most common genetic cause of PD (Parkinson's disease). To investigate how mutations in LRRK2 cause PD, we generated LRRK2 mutant mice either lacking its expression or expressing the R1441C mutant form. Homozygous R1441C knockin mice exhibit no dopaminergic neurodegeneration or alterations in steady-state levels of striatal dopamine, but they show impaired dopamine neurotransmission, as was evident from reductions in amphetamine-induced locomotor activity and stimulated catecholamine release in cultured chromaffin cells as well as impaired dopamine D2 receptor-mediated functions. Whereas LRRK2−/− brains are normal, LRRK2−/− kidneys at 20 months of age develop striking accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein and ubiquitinated proteins, impairment of the autophagy–lysosomal pathway, and increases in apoptotic cell death, inflammatory responses and oxidative damage. Our further analysis of LRRK2−/− kidneys at multiple ages revealed unique age-dependent biphasic alterations of the autophagic activity, which is unchanged at 1 month of age, enhanced at 7 months, but reduced at 20 months. Levels of α-synuclein and protein carbonyls, a general oxidative damage marker, are also decreased in LRRK2−/− kidneys at 7 months of age. Interestingly, this biphasic alteration is associated with increased levels of lysosomal proteins and proteases as well as progressive accumulation of autolysosomes and lipofuscin granules. We conclude that pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 impair the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, and LRRK2 plays an essential role in the dynamic regulation of autophagy function in vivo.},

	abstract = {In the translation of discoveries from the laboratory to the clinic, the track record in developing disease-modifying therapies in neurodegenerative disease is poor. A carefully designed development pipeline built from discoveries in both pre-clinical models and patient populations is necessary to optimize the chances for success. Genetic variation in the leucine-rich repeat kinase two gene (LRRK2) is linked to Parkinson disease (PD) susceptibility. Pathogenic mutations, particularly those in the LRRK2 GTPase (Roc) and COR domains, increase LRRK2 kinase activities in cells and tissues. In some PD models, small molecule LRRK2 kinase inhibitors that block these activities also provide neuroprotection. Herein, the genetic and biochemical evidence that supports the involvement of LRRK2 kinase activity in PD susceptibility is reviewed. Issues related to the deﬁnition of a therapeutic window for LRRK2 inhibition and the safety of chronic dosing are discussed. Finally, recommendations are given for a biomarker-guided initial entry of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors in PD patients. Four key areas must be considered for achieving neuroprotection with LRRK2 kinase inhibitors in PD: 1) identiﬁcation of patient populations most likely to beneﬁt from LRRK2 kinase inhibitors, 2) prioritization of superior LRRK2 small molecule inhibitors based on open disclosures of drug performance, 3) incorporation of biomarkers and empirical measures of LRRK2 kinase inhibition in clinical trials, and 4) utilization of appropriate eﬃcacy measures guided in part by rigorous pre-clinical modeling. Meticulous and rational development decisions can potentially prevent incredibly costly errors and provide the best chances for LRRK2 inhibitors to slow the progression of PD.},

Previously, we showed that the G2019S pathogenic mutation can cause a dramatic increase ({\textasciitilde}10 fold) in kinase activity, far above other published studies. A notable experimental difference was the use of Mn-ATP as a substrate. Therefore, the effects of metal cation-ATP cofactors on LRRK2 kinase activity were investigated. It is shown, using several divalent metal cations, that only Mg2+ or Mn2+ can support LRRK2 kinase activity. However, for wild-type, I2020T and R1441C LRRK2, Mn2+ was significantly less effective at supporting kinase activity. In sharp contrast, both Mn2+and Mg2+ were effective at supporting the activity of G2019S LRRK2. These divergent effects associated with divalent cation usage and the G2019S mutation were predominantly due to differences in catalytic rates. However, LRRK2 was shown to have much lower ({\textasciitilde}40 fold) ATP Km for Mn-ATP compared to Mg-ATP. Consequently, substoichiometric concentrations of Mn2+ can act to inhibit the kinase activity of wild-type, but not G2019S LRRK2 in the presence of Mg2+. From these findings, a new model is proposed for a possible function of LRRK2 and the consequence of the G2019S LRRK2 pathogenic mutation.},

	abstract = {One of the most common monogenic forms of Parkinson disease (PD) is caused by mutations in the LRRK2 gene that encodes leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2 mutations, and particularly the most common mutation Gly2019Ser, are observed in patients with autosomal dominant PD and in those with apparent sporadic PD, who are clinically indistinguishable from those with idiopathic PD. The discoveries that pathogenic mutations in the LRRK2 gene increase LRRK2 kinase activity and that small-m olecule LRRK2 kinase inhibitors can be neuroprotective in preclinical models of PD have placed LRRK2 at the centre of disease modification efforts in PD. Recent investigations also suggest that LRRK2 has a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic PD and that LRRK2 therapies might, therefore, be beneficial in this common subtype of PD. In this Review , we describe the characteristics of LRRK2-associated PD that are most relevant to the development of LRRK2-targeted therapies and the design and implementation of clinical trials. We highlight strategies for correcting the effects of mutations in the LRRK2 gene, focusing on how to identify which patients are the optimal candidates and how to decide on the timing of such trials. In addition, we discuss challenges in implementing trials of disease-m odifying treatment in people who carry LRRK2 mutations.},

	abstract = {Parkinson disease is the second-most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects 2–3\% of the population ≥65 years of age. Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, which causes striatal dopamine deficiency, and intracellular inclusions containing aggregates of α‑synuclein are the neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson disease. Multiple other cell types throughout the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system are also involved, probably from early disease onwards. Although clinical diagnosis relies on the presence of bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, Parkinson disease is associated with many non-motor symptoms that add to overall disability. The underlying molecular pathogenesis involves multiple pathways and mechanisms: α‑synuclein proteostasis, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport and neuroinflammation. Recent research into diagnostic biomarkers has taken advantage of neuroimaging in which several modalities, including PET, single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and novel MRI techniques, have been shown to aid early and differential diagnosis. Treatment of Parkinson disease is anchored on pharmacological substitution of striatal dopamine, in addition to non-dopaminergic approaches to address both motor and non-motor symptoms and deep brain stimulation for those developing intractable l‑DOPA-related motor complications. Experimental therapies have tried to restore striatal dopamine by gene-based and cell-based approaches, and most recently, aggregation and cellular transport of α‑synuclein have become therapeutic targets. One of the greatest current challenges is to identify markers for prodromal disease stages, which would allow novel disease-modifying therapies to be started earlier.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) as a protein that is likely central to the aetiology of Parkinson’s disease, a considerable amount of work has gone into uncovering its basic cellular function. This effort has led to the implication of LRRK2 in a bewildering range of cell biological processes and pathways, and probable roles in a number of seemingly unrelated medical conditions. In this review we summarise current knowledge of the basic biochemistry and cellular function of LRRK2. Topics covered include the identification of phosphorylation substrates of LRRK2 kinase activity, in particular Rab proteins, and advances in understanding the activation of LRRK2 kinase activity via dimerisation and association with membranes, especially via interaction with Rab29. We also discuss biochemical studies that shed light on the complex LRRK2 GTPase activity, evidence of roles for LRRK2 in a range of cell signalling pathways that are likely cell type specific, and studies linking LRRK2 to the cell biology of organelles. The latter includes the involvement of LRRK2 in autophagy, endocytosis, and processes at the transGolgi network, the endoplasmic reticulum and also key microtubule-based cellular structures. We further propose a mechanism linking LRRK2 dimerisation, GTPase function and membrane recruitment with LRRK2 kinase activation by Rab29. Together these data paint a picture of a research field that in many ways is moving forward with great momentum, but in other ways has not changed fundamentally. Many key advances have been made, but very often they seem to lead back to the same places.},

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a crucial factor to understanding the etiology of PD. LRRK2 is a large, widely expressed, multi-domain and multifunctional protein. LRRK2 mutations are the major cause to inherited and sporadic PD. In this review, we discuss the pathology and clinical features which show diversity and variability of LRRK2-associated PD. In addition, we do a thorough literature review and provide theoretical data for gene counseling. Further, we present the evidence linking LRRK2 to various possible pathogenic mechanism of PD such as α-synuclein, tau, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic dysfunction as well as autophagy-lysosomal system. Based on the above work, we investigate activities both within GTPase and outside enzymatic regions in order to obtain a potential therapeutic approach to solve the LRRK2 problem.},

	abstract = {Negative feedback is known to enable biological and man-made systems to perform reliably in the face of uncertainties and disturbances. To date, synthetic biological feedback circuits have primarily relied upon protein-based, transcriptional regulation to control circuit output. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules that can inhibit translation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). In this work, we modelled, built and validated two synthetic negative feedback circuits that use rationally-designed sRNAs for the ﬁrst time. The ﬁrst circuit builds upon the well characterised tet-based autorepressor, incorporating an externally-inducible sRNA to tune the effective feedback strength. This allows more precise ﬁnetuning of the circuit output in contrast to the sigmoidal, steep input–output response of the autorepressor alone. In the second circuit, the output is a transcription factor that induces expression of an sRNA, which inhibits translation of the mRNA encoding the output, creating direct, closed-loop, negative feedback. Analysis of the noise proﬁles of both circuits showed that the use of sRNAs did not result in large increases in noise. Stochastic and deterministic modelling of both circuits agreed well with experimental data. Finally, simulations using ﬁtted parameters allowed dynamic attributes of each circuit such as response time and disturbance rejection to be investigated.},

	abstract = {Buffering, the use of reservoirs of molecules to maintain concentrations of key molecular species, and negative feedback are the primary known mechanisms for robust homeostatic regulation. To our knowledge, however, the fundamental principles behind their combined effect have not been elucidated. Here, we study the interplay between buffering and negative feedback in the context of cellular homeostasis. We show that negative feedback counteracts slow-changing disturbances, whereas buffering counteracts fast-changing disturbances. Furthermore, feedback and buffering have limitations that create trade-offs for regulation: instability in the case of feedback and molecular noise in the case of buffering. However, because buffering stabilizes feedback and feedback attenuates noise from slower-acting buffering, their combined effect on homeostasis can be synergistic. These effects can be explained within a traditional control theory framework and are consistent with experimental observations of both ATP homeostasis and pH regulation in vivo. These principles are critical for studying robustness and homeostasis in biology and biotechnology.},

While the potential impact of this new technology is enormous, there are challenges that we need to overcome before the impact of synthetic biology can be fully realized. Many of these challenges fall beyond the scope of molecular biology and are indeed “system-level” problems, where very little research is being performed. This paper identiﬁes pressing challenges in synthetic biology that can be formulated as systems and control theoretic problems and outlines potentially new systems and control theories/tools that are required to tackle such problems. The aim is to attract more systems and control theorists to collaborate with molecular biologists and biophysicists and help synthetic biology reach its promise. At the same time, engaging the systems and control community more broadly into the rich research opportunities and life-changing applications of synthetic biology may provide added visibility to the ﬁeld of systems and controls.},

\section{Reaction networks and controllers}

Recently, an experimental technique to lower non-functional prion proteins in the brain.
Harnesses the endogenous DNA methylation machinery
kinetically tuned self-silencing approach.

antisenseoligonucleotides require chronicc dosing
Epigenetic silencing
Challenges include reducing the toxicity of editing tools and delivering them to cells without compromising their potency

the framework can be combined with other tags etc, it's small enough to be built on

CRISPRoff, but with delivery

ctivate components of DNA methyltransferases

validates my model, safer epigentic silencing is exciting for other disease, but just adds to the toolbox of reaction networks we can build up from controlling expression.

(john biggins liquid crystal elastomers is very cool)

one can heat or cool all of the lioquid crysal elastomers for shape froming


(e.g. Thomas Michaels)

Seen a lot of research around controlling reaction rates via phase separation, but these things haven't been built yet.

Partitioning vs slow moving (mobility)

Well mixed models etc.

(Fluid structure interactions, e.g. Kirigami Sophie)

(Mechanical neaural netowrk - Vishal Patil)

\section{Dump}

The intersection between lipids and aggregations,
proteins that form cured aggregates
modelling bilayer folds as aggregates (i.e. can grow/shrink + diffusion)



LLPSxAggregation... https://www.alzforum.org/news/research-news/do-tau-fibrils-form-droplets



Protein engineering and enzyme tuning done at the level of the protein, but not at the level of the interactions etc.

Proteins are the workhorses of the cell and sub-cellular environments. Recently lots of work has investigated the problem of protein structure, that is, understanding how the sequence of amino acids residues that make up a protein can be mapped to their shape and how this affects function. In this these I look at cooperative effects between proteins. This is a higher level of organisation that occurs due to interactions between proteins giving organisation in space and time and across length scales. I will investigate these processes using mathematical models to understand the key mechanisms that drive the emergent structures we observe. This work is focused on understanding three examples of protein organisation which can then be hijacked for bio-engineering or this understanding can be used to design rational therapeutics for diseases associated with protein organisation.
